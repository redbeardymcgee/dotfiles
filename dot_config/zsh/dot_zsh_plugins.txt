### Local Plugins with Variables
#
# If you want to use variables in this file, you will need to use the envsubst utility.
# It may come installed on your system, or be available in your OS package manager. Or,
# you can use the Python one-liner wrapper function included in this sample project.
# To replace environment variables, you need to change your `antidote bundle` call to
# this.
