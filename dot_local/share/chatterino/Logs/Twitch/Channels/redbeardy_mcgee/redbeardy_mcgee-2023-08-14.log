[13:33:10]  apneaa: *hair
[13:34:44]  its_goddy: i think in multiplayer, you'd need to embrace the complete chaos, even play on a lower difficulty just to keep up that rythem
[13:35:59]  nerdbusta1: Transform into thunder strike and force field SeemsGood
[13:36:53]  nerdbusta1: I probably take the transform and pray here. There’s no shop before elite
[13:37:45]  kurol__: Robit
[13:38:11]  muirthemne: kurit PETTHEFROG
[13:38:13]  paparatto18: robutt

[13:46:34]  kurol__: Here we go
[13:47:18]  kurol__: Kil
[13:47:25]  kurol__: The Snap card
[13:47:30]  nerdbusta1: good cards
[13:47:33]  kurol__: Kinda crazy
[13:48:00]  nerdbusta1: I take snap and ftl over skip

[13:51:25]  paparatto18: i've been building ball decks
[13:51:26]  paparatto18: pretty good
[13:51:35]  kurol__: Id rather have this Beam in act 2

[13:53:30]  kurol__: It is act 1
[13:53:45]  toamini: who is boss fight?
[13:53:48]  kurol__: Sentries Laga is dead
[13:54:42]  kurol__: Tbh I have a feeling his Ball is not even for the next floor Nob
[13:55:08]  kurol__: Because you dont die to Nob with Beam Weak Pot
[13:55:23]  kurol__: But Burning Nob can happen
[13:55:30]  nerdbusta1: If we’re fighting two elites before a fire I like the ball for output
[13:55:31]  kurol__: Hexa is not enough damage
[13:56:24]  kurol__: I also dont like going too low because advanced hallway is nasty
[13:56:30]  kurol__: So I guess you take the Ball
[13:57:26]  kurol__: I would appreciate this Beam later in Leader prob but maybe Doom next floor
[13:57:36]  kurol__: And then you ask why you take the Ball and move on
[14:00:06]  leprochauninja: getting nobbed
[14:00:25]  kurol__: Listening to kuro and get owned : l
[14:00:28]  kurol__: Whats new

[14:02:54]  kurol__: Was Ball even killing 1 turn earlier
[14:03:18]  kurol__: Maybe if its drawn turn 1
[14:06:16]  leprochauninja: slimes not leaving after splitting is weird. Do they even understand what it means to split?
[14:06:20]  kurol__: Beam bzzz
[14:07:04]  apneaa: i think rebound
[14:07:10]  apneaa: is a simmilar action as barrage
[14:07:16]  apneaa: defect is yeeting orb slots
[14:07:22]  apneaa: inflicting physical damage on impact
[14:07:40]  apneaa: beam cell is like
[14:07:42]  apneaa: a pulse
[14:07:45]  apneaa: from his core

[14:10:42]  kurol__: Darkness puke
[14:11:02]  apneaa: fission

[14:11:09]  apneaa: runic cube
[14:11:12]  apneaa: for the defect
[14:12:07]  kurol__: Old Coin
[14:13:18]  muirthemne: brioNotes
[14:14:56]  kurol__: Block Hexa
[14:15:22]  apneaa: battery is bad because you have lantern

[14:15:33]  apneaa: t1
[14:16:28]  apneaa: dude

[14:17:52]  leprochauninja: probably doable with the pots
[14:18:13]  leprochauninja: click card
[14:18:16]  leprochauninja: fish value
[14:18:28]  kurol__: This Ball might be needed for Hexa tho
[14:18:37]  kurol__: Deck kinda suck at the damage thing
[14:18:55]  leprochauninja: the transform 2 is gonna hurt your fish value when you get pbox
[14:18:56]  kurol__: I guess Discharge Fogus Pot
[14:18:56]  enriqueque: I'm also a ball enjoyer here
[14:18:57]  enriqueque: Wait
[14:18:58]  kurol__: Its fine
[14:19:19]  kurol__: If you cant Discharge it its bad tho
[14:19:48]  kurol__: I mean
[14:19:53]  kurol__: You can bottom deck it
[14:28:12]  kurol__: Strangely decent Cap but AFO Cell
[14:28:14]  kurol__: Wowie
[14:31:37]  its_goddy: your deck is so energy hungry
[14:33:54]  leprochauninja: should you upgrade zap/dualcast for afo value?
[14:35:39]  muirthemne: brioBounce brioBounce brioBounce
[14:36:05]  enriqueque: Is glugging a thing this fight?
[14:36:11]  muirthemne: PikaRamen
[14:36:35]  sycocell: hey beardy!! how are you today?
[14:43:01]  enriqueque: Beam deck confirmed
[14:43:35]  muirthemne: cakeumBlast
[14:43:38]  enriqueque: Gotta complete the trio. Cell, Sweep, Hyper
[14:44:06]  enriqueque: Plus the cow
[14:44:09]  nerdbusta1: Afo since sneko eye is in the box SeemsGood
[14:44:43]  sycocell: ^ woah
[14:44:45]  nerdbusta1: Lmao
[14:45:06]  kurol__: Well
[14:45:07]  nerdbusta1: a blind squirrel occasionally finds a nut
[14:45:09]  kurol__: Nice box
[14:45:25]  kurol__: Snecko sucks
[14:45:35]  nerdbusta1: Boxamid
[14:46:16]  kurol__: This deck tricks you into thinking its a decent Snecko deck
[14:46:40]  kurol__: Ok
[14:46:44]  kurol__: It has Dream Catcher
[14:46:47]  kurol__: Sustain
[14:46:49]  kurol__: Wow
[14:47:47]  toamini: LUL 2 more glaciers
[14:47:55]  nerdbusta1: oh good. Cards already in the deck
[14:48:04]  enriqueque: What even is this deck now
[14:48:17]  kurol__: Blizzard dream : l
[14:48:28]  enriqueque: Time for an unironic blizzard, yeah
[14:48:54]  enriqueque: Discord bloop
[14:50:12]  nerdbusta1: Can we fight elites? I’m kinda terrified of all of them
[14:52:52]  enriqueque: We are stocked to the robot teeth with AOE for gremlins/slavers. If there is a flex pot somewhere in the first few rewards, that would be amazing
[14:53:24]  moribund: FeelsBeardMan
[14:53:36]  moribund: no ads when I joined :D
[14:54:26]  enriqueque: Damn, good draw
[14:55:24]  enriqueque: Gopher is often welcome, but it is not green
[14:57:05]  nerdbusta1: Robot owns
[14:57:23]  moribund: kunai gg
[14:57:41]  nerdbusta1: ninja relict
[14:57:45]  leprochauninja: oh wow you didn't get cursed
[14:58:13]  leprochauninja: spoon seems fun
[14:58:19]  leprochauninja: click spoon
[14:58:41]  enriqueque: Spoon apps
[14:59:08]  leprochauninja: I don't have the time
[14:59:51]  leprochauninja: you better not regret passing spoon later
[15:01:09]  leprochauninja: it would say at the bottom
[15:01:13]  moribund: LUL
[15:02:09]  leprochauninja: I'm pretty sure strength is added on after though
[15:02:36]  leprochauninja: and beko is probably treated the same
[15:03:04]  muirthemne: 2020Shred
[15:03:48]  leprochauninja: blizzard would be pretty nuts if it was added on before the multiplication
[15:12:21]  moribund: stick
[15:12:31]  enriqueque: Stick + Spoon enjoyers
[15:12:32]  leprochauninja: coulda have spanched
[15:12:46]  eggzu_: game
[15:12:47]  enriqueque: Wait, that's anti-synergistic
[15:13:01]  leprochauninja: no no no
[15:13:05]  leprochauninja: it's good
[15:13:22]  enriqueque: Well of course, the skills are free
[15:13:41]  leprochauninja: it's not really anti-synergistic
[15:14:01]  enriqueque: Double Energy + Branch though
[15:14:04]  eggzu_: im good, excited to get into this game properly
[15:14:44]  eggzu_: ez game just dont get baited into taking every card B) it's that ez
[15:15:44]  enriqueque: Zap minus
[15:16:10]  eggzu_: im gonna make some food but i be lurkin
[15:16:56]  leprochauninja: beardy were you a teenage anarchist? I feel like you didn't develop into your anarchist tendencies until your 20s.
[15:17:11]  enriqueque: The double energy upgrade feels like a 2 energy upgrade
[15:18:30]  stupidketchup: hello stupid143Pride
[15:19:17]  stupidketchup: people need to take a break from me all the time. i understand Kappa
[15:19:46]  stupidketchup: ooo i see blizzard
[15:20:41]  stupidketchup: the chillest streamer
[15:21:33]  stupidketchup: wow that blizzard was a cleave on turn 1 PogChamp
[15:22:11]  moribund: Blizzard generator
[15:22:15]  stupidketchup: lol this is so fun to watch
[15:23:41]  stupidketchup: nicely played
[15:23:56]  nerdbusta1: blizzard is a good card Kreygasm
[15:31:41]  jolbalrok: leftiBinocolars i actually catched a stream
[15:31:54]  jolbalrok: *caught? English hard
[15:33:28]  leprochauninja: Supongo que no necesito usar inglés aquí.
[15:34:43]  moribund: 尿液儲存在球裡
[15:37:23]  jolbalrok: leftiJammers leftiJammers
[15:37:36]  moribund: wormJAM
[15:37:43]  moribund: grubJAM
[15:37:53]  leprochauninja: it's worm jam
[15:38:10]  moribund: looks like the bad guy from Dead by Daylight
[15:38:22]  moribund: or maybe Jason
[15:38:30]  moribund: some masked scary boy
[15:38:43]  jolbalrok: It's Trapper from Dead By daylight doing a silly little dance
[15:42:05]  moribund: doing damage to Champ instead of one-shotting with Blizzard dkShame
[15:45:20]  japimport: whoa is this guy a streaker or something
[15:52:13]  enriqueque: Dammit Champ
[15:54:23]  captainfalcum: moneym59JACKIE
[15:54:36]  enriqueque: That stupid mushroom event would have been so easy in act 1 too, with two sweeping beams
[15:58:00]  draqeo: Blessed run.
[15:58:01]  enriqueque: Hey! That's my boot!
[15:58:47]  draqeo: Hey, just tuning into a chill stream before bed. Good luck with ironclad! :)
[15:59:13]  draqeo: need to wake up for work in 6 hours :(
[15:59:32]  dr0gulus: fall asleep RIGHT NOW
[15:59:56]  captainfalcum: anyone sleepy bo beepy
[16:03:23]  dr0gulus: wave deck
[16:03:30]  dr0gulus: 🌊
[16:04:21]  dr0gulus: frostprime's stream title is "cummies" @CaptainFalcum
[16:04:24]  dr0gulus: thought u should know
[16:06:24]  valet_z_rukava: will punning without the redeem be punished
[16:07:11]  draqeo: @ValeT_z_Rukava you won't know unless you czech.
[16:07:33]  oohbleh: redbea13PWF_HF oops what happened here
[16:08:25]  oohbleh: oh no I flipped ur emote silly
[16:09:17]  valet_z_rukava: @draqeo Norway you just did that
[16:09:40]  valet_z_rukava: Kappa
[16:10:32]  draqeo: my pun was more funnier because his username is actual Czech LUL
[16:10:49]  dr0gulus: power pot for 15 damage PogChamp
[16:11:32]  dr0gulus: you can always shockwave next turn
[16:12:16]  valet_z_rukava: @draqeo Eh it's actually not? my nickname is kinda sorta joke in ukrainian lol. But yeah same language family, kind of :D
[16:12:44]  valet_z_rukava: Alive gaming pog
[16:13:48]  stupidketchup: can confirm. the us be like that LUL
[16:14:24]  bunhara: you're asked to describe your lineage when you arent white actually lol
[16:14:33]  oohbleh: *eyes narrow ahead of likely weird replies from chat about this topic*
[16:14:36]  bunhara: pretty common experience to be asked "so like, where are you from"
[16:15:01]  oohbleh: @bunhara "no, where are you *actually* from"
[16:15:09]  elad_o: @bunhara also if you have *any" kind of none American accent
[16:15:44]  bunhara: also many hispanics do tend to talk about their lineage. they hold a lot of pride in their dysporia
[16:15:57]  draqeo: diaspora?
[16:15:59]  oohbleh: *diaspora
[16:16:01]  bunhara: and anyone with parents who are foreigners, actually
[16:16:05]  dr0gulus: dysphoria
[16:16:06]  bunhara: yeah diaspora
[16:16:13]  dr0gulus: hispanic dysphoria Sadge
[16:16:17]  oohbleh: bun you got the word there confused with the otherr d word
[16:16:28]  oohbleh: not to be confused with the other d word
[16:16:33]  dr0gulus: dick
[16:16:34]  dr0gulus: ?
[16:16:37]  bunhara: daffy?
[16:16:46]  dr0gulus: PogChamp
[16:16:55]  bunhara: do not batchest my dr0gulus
[16:16:59]  dr0gulus: excuse me sir but could you count how many RELICS you have at this moment?
[16:17:06]  valet_z_rukava: I've heard that "oooh I'm 1.7% french respect my heritage" is a real american thing, is that true or just a slander? lol
[16:17:29]  bunhara: it's something white people who dont want to be seen as just white will say
[16:17:34]  bunhara: but not typically like, french
[16:17:39]  bunhara: most of the time theyll say like
[16:17:43]  apneaa: youre only of french heritage if you consume vast amount of cheese for no other reason than you like it
[16:17:45]  bunhara: native american or african or something
[16:18:12]  dr0gulus: yeah my mom tried to make me check native american and white on my college applications
[16:18:25]  apneaa: you can have 90% french blood, if i come to your house and theres not at least 5 cheeses in the fridge
[16:18:33]  apneaa: i'm revoking your nationality
[16:18:34]  dr0gulus: because every white family claims to have a distant native ancestor
[16:18:35]  apneaa: right there
[16:18:39]  dr0gulus: because then its OK
[16:18:49]  valet_z_rukava: @apneaa LUL
[16:19:11]  bunhara: "dude hop off my back and let me dress as an indian chief for halloween, im like. 2.6% native anyway"
[16:19:19]  draqeo: XD
[16:19:27]  apneaa: @bunhara well
[16:19:30]  apneaa: at what % is it ok
[16:19:32]  apneaa: :/
[16:19:44]  bunhara: when you're socially native imo
[16:19:56]  apneaa: what if youre native adopted monkaS
[16:19:57]  dr0gulus: @Apneaa it depends on the skull, you know this
[16:20:09]  apneaa: @dr0gulus native ancestry monka
[16:20:18]  bunhara: @apneaa i think you should still have the capacity to recognize you arent of a certain race
[16:20:44]  apneaa: but what if youre a certain social % and a certain blood %
[16:20:47]  bunhara: like me as a black person, i wouldnt be comfortable with a white person adopted by a black family saying yhe n word
[16:20:53]  oohbleh: my mom raised me with a lot of stories of how our recently-not-Russian-nobility-anymore family fled wars and smuggled themselves across borders, but I stopped being super connected to it when I got older. Being white is weird, there is an incentive to Assimilate.
[16:20:57]  bunhara: but like, participating in black culture is fine
[16:21:56]  bunhara: @oohbleh thats kind of a foreigner thing, not just white
[16:22:08]  apneaa: irc i think christophe andre got shit for not being black enough for his jokes on blacks
[16:22:13]  apneaa: and not jew enough for his jokes on jews
[16:22:21]  apneaa: monkaS
[16:22:22]  bunhara: its very common for foreign families to raise their children to be less traditional so they can better fit in with the society around them
[16:22:44]  bunhara: which is why, for example, a mot of hispanic people cant speak Spanish or at least speak it very well
[16:22:52]  oohbleh: @bunhara ye, it Wants To Consume All
[16:24:26]  oohbleh: I definitely got purged out of academia. I wasn't the desirable and didn't want to suffer anymore for my passions.
[16:24:54]  bunhara: @apneaa idk anything about christophe andre so I cant really say much. but I can clearly see why people say he doesnt look black enough lol, he's pretty white passing
[16:25:00]  bunhara: but its like person by person typically
[16:25:10]  bunhara: on what they're willing to allow. their limits, etc
[16:25:47]  bunhara: i can see why some would be uncomfy with it, but a lot of times, it can definitely come off as very "unfair"
[16:27:34]  apneaa: btw bun
[16:27:38]  apneaa: what happened after i collapse
[16:27:42]  apneaa: i think i saw a gnome
[16:27:48]  apneaa: as my brain was shuttingdown
[16:28:00]  bunhara: Adge
[16:28:16]  bunhara: @apneaa we made it to the first giant
[16:28:18]  bunhara: the wolf
[16:28:28]  bunhara: and we got kidnapped by a water monster
[16:28:37]  bunhara: and then had to put her to rest by finding her real name
[16:28:57]  bunhara: and we entered a dream sequence
[16:29:15]  bunhara: that revealed to us that it was actually us who threw away our mother's things
[16:29:20]  bunhara: and our father took the blame
[16:29:46]  bunhara: after that I put it down for another time

[16:30:12]  bunhara: which is fine. cause I like it, but wow I thought I could knock it out quickly LUL
[16:30:18]  apneaa: i'm still not done with light matter

[16:30:43]  apneaa: had to clear xec vod
[16:30:44]  apneaa: last silent
[16:30:48]  apneaa: incoming
[16:30:54]  apneaa: xec is gonna make the big number
[16:31:01]  bunhara: i missed both xecnar runs dkShame
[16:31:01]  apneaa: the BEEEG number
[16:31:07]  bunhara: i just know one won, and one lost
[16:31:17]  bunhara: wait spoilers monkaS
[16:31:20]  bunhara: my bad apneaa

[16:33:59]  apneaa: @Bunhara the main thing about the silent is that after now 400 xecnar silent vods
[16:34:08]  apneaa: i'm getting "ok" at guessing what he will take
[16:34:52]  apneaa: so not knowing wether the run won or lost or if he's gonna get a certain boss relic

[16:35:45]  badterence: the bonkinator
[16:35:54]  bunhara: @apneaa yea i understand that
[16:36:05]  apneaa: but i dont think vods should be spoilered or anything like that, if you come into an sts stream, expecting discussion of other runs from other streamers is just
[16:36:07]  bunhara: "well this run lost, so clearly this decision was probably just wrong"
