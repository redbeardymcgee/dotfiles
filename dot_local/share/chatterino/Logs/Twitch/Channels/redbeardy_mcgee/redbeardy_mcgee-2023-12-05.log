[13:10:49] fishbots: Good morning. Just perusing random streams to see what kind of cool things people are doing.
[13:12:54] moribund: moneym59SHAME
[13:12:56] fishbots: Cool, always cool to see how people are coding, especially during AoC
[13:13:36] fishbots: I am being boring this year.  Just regular Python for me this time.
[13:15:03] fishbots: Donated USD 50 to support The Trevor Project
[13:15:08] moribund: PogChamp PogChamp PogChamp
[13:15:28] fishbots: good choice of charity too.
[13:16:18] fishbots: All about getting better over time.
[13:18:08] fishbots: I haven't done today's yet. Date night last night instead of coding :)
[13:19:01] fishbots: 12 years and counting...

[13:48:31] leprochauninja: comment your code
[13:48:40] leprochauninja: only monsters don't comment their code
[13:48:55] moribund: self-documenting
[13:50:43] leprochauninja: I always felt like I was good at commenting my stuff, but that's probably because whenever I coded there was always a thought in my head that I was going to pass it on to someone who was going to do it correctly, so I wanted to make sure they understood what I was trying to do.
[13:51:48] leprochauninja: well, my coding experience was always on games where I wasn't the programmer, I was just the whiteboxer who wrote garbage to test things.
[13:53:19] leprochauninja: what is this code for
[13:53:41] moribund: @leprochauninja https://adventofcode.com/2023/about
[14:12:15] apneaa: beardy how are you
[14:12:20] apneaa: yes or no
[14:12:34] moribund: yes
[14:12:47] apneaa: @moribund good
[14:13:02] moribund: 1000101
[14:13:49] leprochauninja: it's capitol I
[14:16:08] leprochauninja: I really hate that there's instructions, Instruction, and Instructions, and they're all different things.
[14:17:59] moribund: I would just call them lines, probably
[14:20:59] leprochauninja: do whatever works for you, but I'd go crazy and probably confuse myself if I wrote my code without a reasonable differentiator.
[14:24:48] leprochauninja: I'm not sure if I can give you a good way to fix it since I'm not entirely sure what each thing is doing. Sometimes you can get by with just using a synonym if there's not a clear purpose of why they're different. So like using Information, or Identifier might work.
[14:25:57] leprochauninja: identifier is at least used in the advent post.

[14:43:28] moribund: ojbSplice
[14:46:13] moribund: I think you may want to refactor things. I'm not sure there is value in creating a variable for seeds
[14:47:42] moribund: I guess seed does make sense, actually
[15:00:06] redbeardy_mcgee: !adge
[15:00:13] moribund: Adge
[15:00:24] redbeardy_mcgee: did you understand what i was talking through moribund
[15:12:24] moribund: I had the stream muted so I didn't hear it
[15:12:28] moribund: but I'll say yes
[15:13:17] moribund: I misread the instructions and didn't see there are 4 seed numbers provided, so I goofed that part
[15:14:08] moribund: I would think it would be easier to put the maps in a csv or something like that so you can parse it how you please
[15:14:53] moribund: it doesn't have to be a csv; it could be some other file format
[15:15:01] moribund: whatever format you're most comfortable with
[15:17:52] moribund: that works
[15:18:12] moribund: yeah I thought you were just trying to parse the literal text
[15:19:04] moribund: I saw that block of text copied from the site and thought that was what you were parsing which would be pchCatDrugs
[16:00:05] moribund: Adge
[16:12:30] moribund: I think I get it, but I don't think I know what part you are missing
[16:12:46] moribund: answer this: Using seed 79 as an example, what is the journey from seed number to location number
[16:14:57] moribund: The way I understand it is: you take your seed number and use the seed-to-soil map to get a soil number. Then you take your soil number and use the soil-to-fertilizer map to get a fertilizer number, and so on
[16:15:18] moribund: and the maps are basically telling you how to build a lookup table
[16:16:31] moribund: I found reading the section starting with "Consider again the example seed-to-soil map" the most helpful
[16:17:25] moribund: correct
[16:46:05] moribund: I think I got it figured out on paper. Some of the word problemy stuff is a bit of a red herring
[17:18:29] moribund: I don't think you should be doing any min calculations when going through the maps
[17:19:05] moribund: the only min calculation you want to do is at the end when you get all of the location numbers
[17:19:09] moribund: you want the minimum location number
[17:38:29] vmservice: are u doing p2
[17:38:31] vmservice: it's so fucked
[17:38:40] vmservice: monka
[17:38:56] moribund: there's a part 2? monkaS
[17:39:02] vmservice: oh boi p2
[17:40:41] vmservice: if seed 13 doesn't match the first line in the map but matches the second line and return 60 you need to return 60
[17:40:48] vmservice: you can't just take the min of all 3 lines
[17:41:09] vmservice: but if none of the lines match you can return 13
[17:41:16] vmservice: yeah i think  i saw
[17:41:20] vmservice: no p1
[17:42:52] vmservice: yeah you can't reduce you need to filter for a valid line and if there are none you return the input
[17:44:30] moribund: seed 79 corresponds to soil 81
[17:44:34] vmservice: o
[17:44:37] vmservice: nvm
[17:44:55] vmservice: i think line 128 is the wrong one
[17:45:15] vmservice: like you need to feed the output of map1 to map2
[17:48:20] moribund: what do you mean by position
[17:48:28] moribund: that word isn't used in the problem, so I don't know where it comes from
[17:49:39] vmservice: then you need to feed 81 to the second map
[17:49:42] moribund: ^
[17:50:35] moribund: I think it's a variable name problem
[17:51:20] vmservice: i don;t see you saving the map's output to anywhere
[17:51:26] vmservice: i just the the for loop
[17:51:48] vmservice: no like each of the maps provided by the problems
[17:52:11] vmservice: ok doesn't reduce return a value
[17:52:22] vmservice: where is that value used?
[17:52:55] vmservice: don't you need to x = wahtever.reduce
[17:53:02] vmservice: like line 130
[17:53:34] vmservice: monkaS
[17:54:07] vmservice: you can't return
[17:54:20] vmservice: you need to feed the result of reduce into the next iteration of the for loop
[17:54:48] vmservice: then do like seed = foobar
[17:56:44] moribund: can you walk me through the path of where your input updates in your code
[17:58:03] vmservice: on line 146 you are always passing the original seed to the reduce
[17:58:19] moribund: yeah, you're just starting with the seed number again which is always 79
[17:58:54] vmservice: it doesn't because there are 4 seeds as input
[17:59:07] moribund: those are just soil numbers
[17:59:59] moribund: Adge
[18:00:03] vmservice: Adge
[18:00:11] redbeardy_mcgee: Adge
[18:01:39] vmservice: just do var input = seed before the for loop then do input = map.reduce
[18:01:41] tonytwitch: Why is it reducing?
[18:01:50] vmservice: tony
[18:01:54] vmservice: did u do day 5
[18:01:55] tonytwitch: You only apply one instruction line per seed
[18:02:28] tonytwitch: I did day 5 last night
[18:02:31] vmservice: o
[18:02:45] vmservice: p2 crashed my stream
[18:02:49] vmservice: LUL
[18:03:06] vmservice: then i made it run in 50ms
[18:03:07] tonytwitch: Oh, you did brute force? I did it the clever way
[18:03:33] vmservice: brute force is always worth trying in case it works
[18:03:38] vmservice: then i don't have to do more work
[18:03:44] tonytwitch: You want to apply one instruction line, but need to figure out which one.
[18:03:44] vmservice: smile
[18:04:01] tonytwitch: Eh, I saw the numbers were too big for brute force.
[18:04:14] vmservice: looking at input file is cheating
[18:04:23] tonytwitch: hehe
[18:05:16] moribund: monkaGIGA
[18:06:26] tonytwitch: Oh I see, the reduce is ok. I think a for loop would be a little easier to read
[18:06:37] tonytwitch: But the reduce might apply multiple lines
[18:06:47] tonytwitch: You might map multiple times
[18:07:22] tonytwitch: LUL lots of people learned scheme at university (not me)
[18:08:08] tonytwitch: The reduce might apply multiple instruction lines, which is problematic
[18:09:45] tonytwitch: I forget how reduce works
[18:11:42] tonytwitch: Yeah, the accumulator is the problem
[18:12:00] tonytwitch: Yes, the instructions don't overlap
[18:12:15] tonytwitch: But once you transform a number, you might transform again
[18:12:25] tonytwitch: The instruction ranges don't overlap
[18:13:06] tonytwitch: In the same seed-to-soil, you have 2 instructionLines
[18:13:23] tonytwitch: You might apply both of them to seed.
[18:13:51] tonytwitch: Right, you need to break out when an instructionLine matches
[18:13:58] tonytwitch: Yes, need to break out somehow
[18:14:41] tonytwitch: It's hard to break out of a reduce
[18:14:55] tonytwitch: That's why reduce isn't great here and a for loop is better ðŸ™‚
[18:37:17] dank_maymeis: I sure hope you're not doing this in Typescript LUL
[18:40:25] leprochauninja: did you solve it
[18:43:10] leprochauninja: backseat gaming
[18:56:15] leprochauninja: I blame the neow bonus for being unhelpful to the seed
[18:56:38] leprochauninja: you would have solved this otherwise
