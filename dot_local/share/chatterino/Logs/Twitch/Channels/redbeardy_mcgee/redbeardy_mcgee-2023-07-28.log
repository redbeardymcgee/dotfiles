[09:40:00]  captainnoobzor: waking up before noon is a frying experience
[09:40:14]  moneymoneyloot: I think beardy is an underrated streamer. he talks to chat for longer than he plays the actual run and wins every single time
[09:40:31]  captainnoobzor: moneymoneyloot: I think beardy is an underrated streamer. he talks to chat for longer than he plays the actual run and wins every single time

[09:43:36]  captainnoobzor: the only whiff is the part where you take 15
[09:44:09]  captainnoobzor: the worst card you can possibly get is probably envenom
[09:45:19]  moneymoneyloot: captain noobzor hates common relic
[09:45:26]  moneymoneyloot: he clicks choose a card instead
[09:45:40]  moneymoneyloot: im jk he claims he likes it

[09:50:27]  captainnoobzor: what about the beautiful spiker
[09:50:32]  captainnoobzor: money likes to hang out with that one
[09:51:02]  bubbadoongai: my spiker solution is a persuasion check
[09:51:11]  moneymoneyloot: they bring me back to the only grade i succeeded in at school
[09:51:28]  moneymoneyloot: kindergarten
[09:51:41]  dr0gulus: 11th, when he finally learned his shapes
[09:51:41]  moneymoneyloot: the star block goes in the star hole
[09:53:28]  captainnoobzor: good turn 1
[09:53:30]  dr0gulus: while everyone else in the classroom was learning algebra, money was practicing shuffling a deck of cards in the corner. he was a prodigy at a young age.

[09:55:23]  bunhara: nave and I were talking about it last night

[09:55:32]  captainnoobzor: maybe i stream it today if it's good
[09:55:35]  moneymoneyloot: as I carefully placed one card at a time from the top of the deck to the bottom my classmates asked "what are you doing?"
[09:55:36]  bunhara: so we figured Noobzor might play it
[09:55:40]  moneymoneyloot: I'm going infinite :)
[09:55:48]  bunhara: @captainnoobzor its really bad (its good)
[09:55:52]  captainnoobzor: i wanna sample but i cant sleep at night
[09:56:03]  captainnoobzor: modded runs are a way to cure my spire addiction without throwing
[09:56:06]  bunhara: the sample is ruining your life

[09:57:30]  captainnoobzor: dagger spray would have been good just a minute earlier
[09:57:39]  captainnoobzor: i guess terror will have to do then
[09:57:47]  bunhara: found some potions
[09:57:51]  captainnoobzor: punished for not using explo pot
[09:57:54]  bubbadoongai: picking exhaust cards to keep the flash of steel infinite alive

[15:16:53]  duncanarchib: that's a real weird loss cause i got here and all i saw was domination
[15:17:13]  leprochauninja: I mean 45 card deck

[15:23:51]  sycocell: chimera is so fun to watch
[15:24:05]  leprochauninja: I turned it up to 100% so it's pretty chaotic
[15:24:10]  captainnoobzor: chimera is fun
[15:24:23]  captainnoobzor: except when you go double expertise infinite
[15:24:28]  captainnoobzor: then it's a snooze
[15:25:13]  leprochauninja: I'm not sure if 100% is easier than default which is like 10%
[15:25:52]  leprochauninja: It probably is, but only if you're used to it
[15:26:28]  captainnoobzor: i put mine on 33% i think it's just like
[15:26:40]  captainnoobzor: they barely spawn at 10%
[15:26:43]  leprochauninja: not being able to rely on finding cards of certain costs or that do a specific thing without some other effect can make it trickier
[15:27:01]  leprochauninja: 10% was way too low yeah
[15:27:03]  captainnoobzor: 100% could be interesting
[15:27:28]  captainnoobzor: but it also sounds like you can find overpowered shit too easily
[15:28:35]  captainnoobzor: such as X cost cards monkaS
[15:28:35]  leprochauninja: I just turned all the settings on

[18:38:38]  bunhara: also strongly recommend using Slay The Relics for streaming
[18:38:52]  bunhara: it lets pc viewers look at what your relics do and at your deck
[18:39:09]  alenafenomena: oh that's cool, @Bunhara !!
[18:39:12]  bunhara: and if you have another mod, Relic Stats, installed, it shows them how your relics have been performing as well
[18:40:09]  bunhara: also idk if beardy mentioned it, but Rum History Plus is also a good one. it gives you very in-depth information on the Run History screen that the regular game doesnt give you
[18:40:39]  alenafenomena: 👀 glad i asked!
[18:40:45]  bunhara: personally, I cant stand playing the game without Relic Stats and Run History Plus
[18:41:37]  bunhara: the only thing I wish Run History Plus could add is a map of each act
[18:41:41]  alenafenomena: can you show one more time? i'm copying
[18:41:45]  bunhara: but i dint know how possible something like that us

[18:47:12]  moneymoneyloot: i mean noobzor
[18:47:28]  captainnoobzor: yeah those mods are too much for me to take in
[18:47:39]  moneymoneyloot: it just like doesn't let you get punished for forgetting stuff which takes away from the game imo
[18:47:42]  bunhara: relic reminders and minty feel like they just let the player keep their bad habits cause the game tells them anything they need to be aware of
[18:48:03]  moneymoneyloot: bun said it even better
[18:48:08]  captainnoobzor: yeah im more of the bunhara opinion
[18:48:22]  alenafenomena: the SuperFastMode mod seems a reasonable addition for streaming, unless it makes everything look like garbage
[18:48:25]  captainnoobzor: i dont really like relying on mods to do the work for me that just makes me dumber
[18:48:34]  bunhara: i hate superfastmode
[18:48:39]  bunhara: it just makes the game look awful
[18:48:43]  alenafenomena: except that when I get a new card that they only show me for a sec, it's never enough
[18:48:48]  captainnoobzor: but using minty has to be min-max for sure
[18:48:52]  bunhara: base game fast mode is just fine imo
[18:48:54]  alenafenomena: @Bunhara nuf said i'll leave that right alone
[18:49:04]  moneymoneyloot: superfastmode is pretty ugg it's fast enough wit the built in fastmode and 240 fps cap
[18:49:05]  alenafenomena: @Bunhara it's only the birdos that are like COME ON
[18:49:15]  captainnoobzor: i've never seen super fast mode
[18:49:26]  bunhara: you should install fast mode cultists tho KomodoHype
[18:49:27]  alenafenomena: wait there's a built in fastmode?
[18:49:33]  alenafenomena: i'll have to give it a look-see
[18:49:34]  bunhara: yep
[18:49:37]  captainnoobzor: fast mode cultists monka
[18:49:42]  captainnoobzor: do they scale during your turn
[18:49:43]  alenafenomena: dang i'm so lucky to have found you all
[18:49:48]  alenafenomena: subtra2Hug
[18:49:55]  alenafenomena: y'all are the BEST
[18:50:04]  duncanarchib: fast mode is required
[18:50:05]  alenafenomena: hahah
[18:50:05]  bunhara: @captainnoobzor so fast mode fucks cultists specifically
[18:50:12]  alenafenomena: first time raiding a Slayer
[18:50:14]  bunhara: they can no longee say their voice lines in fast mode
[18:50:18]  captainnoobzor: ohh
[18:50:23]  alenafenomena: literally found you on my FIRST try
[18:50:23]  bunhara: fast mode cultists fixes that
[18:50:25]  captainnoobzor: i've never noticed that
[18:50:43]  bunhara: neither have i until i saw the mod LUL
[18:50:47]  alenafenomena: i get such a kick out of "I always win" "I didn't win"
[18:50:52]  alenafenomena: makes me laugh every time
[18:51:32]  bunhara: yeah and it changed my perspective completely
[18:51:36]  bunhara: they censored them

[18:52:25]  captainnoobzor: shopping act
[18:52:35]  captainnoobzor: they really modded the beyond into the mall
[18:52:52]  alenafenomena: i need to get on top of that and roll ads more often, take breaks more often
[18:54:18]  bunhara: taking breaks is super encouraged
[18:54:23]  bunhara: helps a lot
[18:57:40]  alenafenomena: @Bunhara yeah, my stamina is low, so if I don't take breaks then I can't stream very long
[18:58:04]  alenafenomena: wait a sec, have you really been streaming over 9 hours?
[18:58:34]  alenafenomena: i totally misread your time live when I raided, I thought you'd gone live like 8 min before
[18:58:45]  alenafenomena: careful, don't overhydrate
[18:59:07]  alenafenomena: i had one close call, i'm careful now

[19:23:48]  captainnoobzor: it's just that you can bottom deck enlightenment so it's a convenient backup plan
[19:23:58]  captainnoobzor: well technically enlightenment becomes the backup plan
[19:24:28]  captainnoobzor: i guess 4 potions is a good backup plan too
