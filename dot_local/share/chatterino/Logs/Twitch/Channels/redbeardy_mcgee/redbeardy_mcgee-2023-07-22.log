[17:51:10]  killasue: sup redbeardy, been a while :) hows the run going
[17:54:24]  killasue: are you focusing on defect or is it just rotation? deck looks pretty neat overall
[17:56:14]  killasue: I'm glad to hear that honestly. Ive streamed STS for a while and still would like to, but even if Im doing really well the mindset of try-harding every run is so exhausting in this game. so just playing to have fun is probably a really healthy approach :D
[17:57:21]  killasue: Oh for sure, I couldn't do meme runs and stuff, too. But players like us still try-hard a fair amount even casually :P
[17:58:34]  killasue: when Im "taking it easy" I basically just try to not get too salty if I lose a decent run before A4 lol
[17:59:26]  helox79: Oh look, beardy back to streaming!
[18:02:01]  killasue: yeah once you spent 1k+ hours in this game its almost too easy to beat yourself up over all the tiny mistakes that become really apparent once you lose. its precisely why I couldnt stream spire for more than a month daily, Id just be too miserable too often
[18:07:32]  killasue: the draw is pretty nice with echo forms and all the deck manipulation
[18:08:55]  killasue: the finesse would def profit from the flash of steel on top, but the debuff and weak is really nice too

[18:15:28]  killasue: really nice and loopy run
[18:16:51]  killasue: whoops
[18:19:58]  killasue: yeah I think so
[18:22:31]  killasue: it shines extra bright with pyramid I think
[18:23:57]  killasue: I have a feeling that this steam barrier is going to be incredible in act 4 in at least one encounter
[18:24:43]  killasue: lol
[18:25:04]  killasue: tricky
[18:25:44]  killasue: you have so many tutors I think youll find the one turbo if you need it
[18:27:00]  killasue: feel like wed rather take a meteor strike if we want any more energy generation at this point
[18:27:45]  killasue: potential quadruple zap fight Pog

[18:29:04]  blitzn: sup
[18:29:17]  blitzn: doing alright man you
[18:29:44]  blitzn: i never know when to not pick up cards in this game, i think thats why i didnt progress far
[18:30:47]  blitzn: this guy was my favorite char in this game
[18:31:00]  blitzn: the chain lightening stuff was awesome
[18:31:39]  killasue: Ive always been an Ironclad guy. and my second favorite would be silent even though she probably brought the most tedious times upon me lol
[18:33:44]  killasue: its also really hard to just "mail it in" with defect, even if you have a really strong run you can't take turns off with the robot
[18:34:32]  blitzn: you still play pubg at all?
[18:35:04]  blitzn: they put so many broken things in it man, its lost its identify
[18:39:18]  firstdane: can never have too much money
[18:39:20]  firstdane: love that guy
[18:39:37]  firstdane: uptim
[18:40:18]  killasue: seek is good, maaaaybe echo form just for act 4 insurance but I dont think youll need it
[18:42:52]  killasue: Seek+ already doing its job
[18:44:49]  killasue: classic defect, run can deploy like 5 different completely OP strategies, but t1-3 can be a big struggle
[18:49:49]  killasue: you can get rid of bad hand cards
[18:53:36]  killasue: I think you just stall until double self repair into multi cast dark orb. I think double steam barrier is also decent here, it saves card plays vs tutoring 2x
[18:59:59]  killasue: good fight
[19:01:46]  killasue: bottle seek over apo?
[19:03:55]  killasue: violence has a decent chance to find solid cards
[19:04:19]  killasue: compile driver cold snap flash of steel decent targets
[19:05:43]  killasue: I think its really solid here tbh :D rare good violence
[19:10:01]  killasue: stack could be juicy
[19:10:27]  killasue: with pyramid and all the deck manip you can setup really fat stacks imo
[19:12:15]  killasue: really nice plasma
[19:14:08]  killasue: think this is the first time Ive ever seen this interaction
[19:15:14]  killasue: yeah violence thins out the deck pretty well, would have been nice to land the compile driver or flash of steel but its still better having those in the discard than in draw pile. plus the potential stack combo
[19:16:07]  killasue: it happens, dont think this mistake will be too costly if at all
[19:18:58]  killasue: masybe stop playing
[19:19:15]  killasue: to keep the discard pile for next turn
[19:19:20]  killasue: but its w/e
[19:20:10]  killasue: Im for heatsinks
[19:20:23]  killasue: accelerating t1-3 is the one tiny issue this deck still has sometimes
[19:21:12]  killasue: this is a really nice T1
[19:22:02]  killasue: nice
[19:23:22]  killasue: so many lines to play. echo turbo feels good
[19:24:20]  killasue: feels good to get all the nice rolls t1 vs the heart
[19:24:39]  elad_o: Is there a reason not to use the focus pot?
[19:26:16]  theyarejo: ðŸ‘€
[19:26:21]  killasue: liquid memories play?
[19:26:36]  theyarejo: So I have two super cool pieces of news if you donâ€™t mind my sharing
[19:26:37]  killasue: yeah I feel messing with the discard is wrong here
[19:26:49]  theyarejo: 1. New rent stabilized 3BR apartment with a private backyard
[19:27:38]  theyarejo: 2. Starting hormones soon! Taking something called Raloxifene that causes all the normal feminizing things of estrogen without causing breast growth or muscle loss or loss of bone density
[19:27:44]  killasue: private backyard sound really nice. are you the only tenant who has access to the backyard?
[19:27:51]  theyarejo: Yep! @killasue
[19:28:20]  theyarejo: I wanted to be on HRT for like a decade but I didnâ€™t want to grow titties
[19:28:27]  theyarejo: So now I can!
[19:29:01]  theyarejo: It was made for menopausal women who are susceptible to breast cancer but now itâ€™s used for AMAB folks who are trans too
[19:29:04]  theyarejo: Awww youâ€™re so sweet
[19:29:07]  killasue: thats amazing, congratulations! a little backyard can add soe much to to quality of life
[19:29:11]  theyarejo: And yes I think it has been or at least close
[19:29:21]  theyarejo: @killasue agreed!
[19:29:49]  theyarejo: Yeahhhh things are a lot better now :)
[19:29:55]  theyarejo: My sister came out as a woman too last month
[19:30:02]  theyarejo: And my little brother just got married this month
[19:30:24]  theyarejo: If you ever find yourself in NYC and need a guest room to stay in hit me up =P
[19:30:50]  killasue: this turn Id have turbod reinforced
[19:31:51]  killasue: I just wouldnt touch the discard with reboot or deep breath, saving pot for later turn is also fine
[19:32:35]  theyarejo: Haha go for it. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s so nice about this new apartment. People can visit me and not have to pay for a hotwl
[19:32:54]  theyarejo: I mean I actually will have TWO guest rooms but one will mostly be my office
[19:33:03]  killasue: Oh wow you got the nice apartment in NYC on top? jackpot
[19:33:21]  theyarejo: Yeah Iâ€™m so hyped @killasue same price as I used to pay for a 1BR but itâ€™s like 1500 square feet
[19:34:09]  theyarejo: I feel like I very consistently get to the heart on defect and then die when the heart has like 100hp left
[19:34:10]  killasue: that's so nice :)
[19:34:39]  theyarejo: How do you have all that dexterity?
[19:34:40]  killasue: stack is going to block for a single turn on its own
[19:36:03]  theyarejo: Ahhh
[19:36:06]  killasue: this deck has all the cards
[19:37:02]  theyarejo: If only you had good cards like claw
[19:37:38]  killasue: holo can get back stack as well if you want to save energy and block massively
[19:39:59]  killasue: you can but itd be a bit wasted on this turn no
[19:41:36]  killasue: weak into reshuffle with deep breath and secret tech feels like an amazing turn
[19:48:39]  killasue: yeah I like secret tech. and Id probably like 2 dark orbs in the rotation as well. but its also almost 3am and Im brain fried at this point lol I trust you pull through and do the right thing!
[19:54:28]  killasue: with liquid memories youll be able to setup kill with dualcast/multicast and zap next turn
[19:54:49]  killasue: you can holo this turn and liquid memories next right?
[19:56:24]  killasue: ggs nice run!
[19:56:43]  nerdbusta1: GG!
[19:58:40]  killasue: good night beardy, always nice seeing you play spire!
