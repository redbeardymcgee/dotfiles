[10:44:52]  rolieland: Since you play AI turn one now always, would you not like to prog ink bottle turn 2? otherwise you are proging with '3 energy'  so to speak
[10:45:30]  moribund: more likely to trigger bottle again in the same fight if you set it up at 9
[10:45:54]  rolieland: @moribund true
[10:46:32]  moribund: AI+ might mean it's not worth taking damage to fully optimize bottle, maybe
[10:46:44]  moribund: or it makes it less bad, at least
[10:46:47]  rolieland: you squash avocado
[10:47:02]  moribund: but bottle on 9 is still pretty much always optimal

[12:11:29]  apneaa: moribund
[12:11:33]  moribund: Apneaa
[12:12:12]  apneaa: @moribund did you advanced in the dlc since last time?
[12:12:20]  moribund: yeah. I think I've technically finished it
[12:12:28]  apneaa: nice
[12:12:31]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: apneaa

[12:12:45]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: monkaS
[12:12:46]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random how is the wheather
[12:12:50]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: it's good
[12:12:54]  moribund: I strongly suspect there is a true ending that involves beating the DLC and the base game
[12:12:57]  moribund: which I haven't done
[12:12:58]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: way less horrible than where i'm from
[12:13:11]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: it's not as hot or as humid
[12:13:21]  moribund: but I'm pretty confident I reached the end of the DLC
[12:13:28]  apneaa: @moribund byron hasn't done the main ending with soleanum but he know he can do it
[12:13:40]  apneaa: so when he will be done with the dlc we'll do a main ending again
[12:13:47]  moribund: makes sense
[12:14:10]  apneaa: @moribund how did you like the "ending" of the dlc
[12:14:32]  moribund: ending was good. Really great illustration and music
[12:14:58]  apneaa: nice thanks for sharing
[12:15:30]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random how is the langage barrier monkaS

[12:16:12]  apneaa: the nordics are fairly good at english
[12:16:13]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: (of myself)
[12:16:17]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: (and of the scenery)
[12:16:47]  apneaa: i think dutch and above they are really good at english from what i know of their tourists
[12:16:56]  apneaa: south france and spain/portugal
[12:17:01]  apneaa: not very good
[12:17:08]  apneaa: italia also not amazing at english
[12:17:10]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: it's been cool for the
[12:17:17]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: 6 hours i've been here
[12:17:28]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i'm here for a conference and i got a hotel room with a friend
[12:17:45]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: the meta is to GAME
[12:17:56]  apneaa: the meta is to coop wit vms
[12:18:00]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: @apneaa luckily i've decided to learn italian
[12:18:00]  apneaa: NOBAYRS
[12:18:08]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: vm co-op actually busted
[12:18:24]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random oh you wanna go to italy next?
[12:18:30]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: kinda
[12:18:38]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i mostly just want to learn a language
[12:18:43]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: and italian is similar to latin
[12:18:46]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: which i already know some
[12:18:49]  apneaa: if you learn italian
[12:18:58]  apneaa: you will unlock spanish to a certain degree
[12:19:02]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: then i will know most of spanish yeah
[12:19:05]  apneaa: i say to peoples
[12:19:10]  apneaa: that wanna learn a latin langage
[12:19:12]  apneaa: dont learn french
[12:19:14]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: knowing latin is so broken
[12:19:14]  apneaa: learn spanish
[12:19:16]  apneaa: or italian
[12:19:21]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: french DIESOFCRINGE
[12:19:38]  apneaa: latin is so funny
[12:19:54]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: how so?
[12:20:01]  apneaa: it's so freaking hard to read but you can "kinda" do it, my friend had a comic
[12:20:04]  apneaa: it's a huge comic
[12:20:06]  apneaa: all in latin
[12:20:11]  apneaa: and i went through
[12:20:15]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: it is really easy to read
[12:20:18]  apneaa: it's really exhausting but you can read it
[12:20:25]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: even if you just know english you can often follow
[12:20:43]  apneaa: meanwhile italian spanish written is just easy mode
[12:20:45]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: if you know spanish then you're fine probably
[12:20:46]  apneaa: romanian too
[12:22:10]  apneaa: but yeah learning french isntead of italian/spanish is just making your life harder for zero reason
[12:22:34]  apneaa: were just omega weird
[12:22:39]  apneaa: so it end up being cooll
[12:23:19]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: after i learned some latin and read some italian by accident
[12:23:25]  apneaa: we share with vietnamese and a few other langage the biggest number of used vowels and consonnants
[12:23:31]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i wondered if i could do that with spanish and french too
[12:23:35]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: spanish yes french uhhhhhhh
[12:23:40]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random for spanish yes
[12:23:42]  apneaa: fro french too
[12:23:45]  apneaa: unless you read something
[12:23:47]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: not very easily
[12:23:47]  apneaa: with past tense
[12:23:51]  apneaa: or weird tenses
[12:23:58]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: italian i read without noticing it wasn't latin though
[12:24:11]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i thought it was just latin spelled weird
[12:24:14]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: french was turbo monka
[12:24:29]  apneaa: french is latin through a germano celtic filter
[12:24:38]  apneaa: then brought under a latin filter again
[12:24:41]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: english pog
[12:24:55]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: fake romance languages
[12:25:05]  apneaa: english is our bastard baby
[12:25:34]  apneaa: english is just french but you take it further with the germanic influence
[12:25:54]  apneaa: the ONLY point of learning french
[12:25:57]  apneaa: is poetry
[12:26:01]  apneaa: there is ZERO other valid use
[12:26:05]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: cheese
[12:26:09]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: pogslide
[12:27:02]  kurol__: What if I want to learn French
[12:27:25]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: to troll?
[12:28:10]  kurol__: Well
[12:28:23]  apneaa: @KuroL__ i will come to vietnam and slap you
[12:28:23]  kurol__: Our language is kinda based on French to a certain degree
[12:28:39]  apneaa: the only asian langage that use latin alphabet
[12:28:41]  apneaa: Kreygasm
[12:28:52]  kurol__: Its probably not that close
[12:29:00]  kurol__: But might be easier than usual
[12:29:14]  kurol__: Owned by the French
[12:29:20]  apneaa: well i would assume because of the alphabet
[12:29:28]  apneaa: you would have the easiest time out of any asian country
[12:29:33]  apneaa: to learn any western langage
[12:29:52]  apneaa: and also since vietnam is very rich
[12:29:56]  apneaa: with consonnants and vowels
[12:30:42]  apneaa: meanwhile english man use the same letter for like
[12:30:48]  apneaa: 5 different sounds
[12:30:50]  kurol__: I dont have the French accents
[12:30:54]  apneaa: and they cant even make half of them
[12:30:54]  kurol__: The thick husky voice
[12:31:07]  kurol__: Like they smoke since they were 5
[12:31:12]  apneaa: @KuroL__ gotta talk with the throat
[12:31:15]  apneaa: not the tongue
[12:31:22]  apneaa: all in the back baby
[12:31:59]  apneaa: i'm trying to go all the way with russian
[12:32:04]  apneaa: because i have motivation for it now
[12:32:40]  apneaa: yeah i have reasons to learn it other than for fun now
[12:32:47]  apneaa: so it's been a good way to stay at it
[12:33:19]  apneaa: the biggest is that throat singing content is mostly written in russian even tho the langage in it is tuvan
[12:33:35]  apneaa: yeah
[12:33:37]  kurol__: Oh lmao
[12:33:39]  apneaa: tuvan is what they speak
[12:33:47]  apneaa: but they will write comments or descirption
[12:33:50]  apneaa: in russian often
[12:34:29]  apneaa: i wanted to just learn tuvan but tuvan doesn't not have a lot of ressource
[12:34:39]  apneaa: just a small turkik langage
[12:34:50]  apneaa: so i went with russian because i know they all understand it fairly ok

[13:21:29]  eggzu_: at least it seems it currently

[13:23:09]  thederkus: @EggZu_ I would. you don't have to play at max difficulty if ytou don't want to, so it's got something for all lvls

[13:26:53]  eggzu_: oh wait i have a2 on ironclad
[13:27:07]  eggzu_: and a1 on silent and defect
[13:27:38]  thederkus: I find a1 to be easier than  a0
[13:27:45]  thederkus: bc more elities but the elites aren't tougher
[13:27:51]  eggzu_: i dont remember it was a while ago x) but probably i didn't feel like i was improving
[13:30:48]  eggzu_: i will do some more gaming
[13:30:56]  eggzu_: but i'm basically back at square one lol
[13:31:10]  eggzu_: i do want a new game to get into and sts has the kind of depth i want

[13:33:05]  leprochauninja: plasma shrimp sounds better
[13:33:05]  eggzu_: 100% proc with shields up
[13:33:13]  eggzu_: plasma shrimp makes crunchy noice
[13:34:06]  eggzu_: you might as well print all items into that printer
[13:34:13]  eggzu_: insta win
[13:35:35]  leprochauninja: the instincts of a predator
[13:42:25]  eggzu_: dinner has joined the party

[13:43:52]  lostnight512: amazing combo here
[13:43:55]  eggzu_: you could ghet rid of bandolier and berserker's pauldron
[13:45:53]  eggzu_: pauldron i always scrap tbh
[13:46:00]  eggzu_: bandolier is useless vs mithrix is why i'd get rid
[13:46:04]  eggzu_: i like to overkill mithrix
[13:47:31]  eggzu_: straight to the big man
[13:47:49]  eggzu_: always straight to the big man

[14:00:20]  eggzu_: card so you can get monster tooth focus crsystal instead of just focus crystal

[14:03:33]  apneaa: also
[14:03:39]  apneaa: i have done my blood test
