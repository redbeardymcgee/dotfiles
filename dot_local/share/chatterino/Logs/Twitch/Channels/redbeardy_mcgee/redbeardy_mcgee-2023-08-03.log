[09:31:10]  bunhara: its different yeah
[09:31:21]  bunhara: transforms are seeded in their own way
[09:37:12]  bunhara: xecnar's been thinking about how much you're allowed to get away with no damage on clad recently
[09:37:22]  bunhara: playing more like watcher, being more strict on what cards you add
[09:37:33]  bunhara: it reminded me of when youbwere experimenting with that kinda play style
[09:37:38]  bunhara: yeah basically
[09:37:40]  truesque: after adding some damage
[09:37:59]  truesque: it seems like xec will click one damage card and say ok that's enough
[09:38:17]  bunhara: yeah thats the part he doesnt really care about - how often you might be able to force a shitty inf
[09:39:42]  bunhara: clad is so funny
[09:39:59]  bunhara: in a card game, its focal character's olaystyle revolves around saying fuck cards

[10:00:52]  dr0gulus: AND a relic
[10:00:55]  dr0gulus: AND a card

[12:01:36]  truesque: it's so fucked up
[12:02:13]  bunhara: why doesnt chosen show up in act 3 hallways
[12:02:13]  moneymoneyloot: i think beardy is an underrated streamer. he talks to chat more than he plays the actual game and wins every single time
[12:02:36]  captainfalcum: hey guys I just reached the ascension level 5 on the silent. been having a lot of fun with this game. I think I might be addicted! :)
[12:02:41]  truesque: I deeply regret wondering why the fusion hammer icon wasn't a hammer
[12:02:53]  muirthemne: coxFeedMe
[12:02:54]  bunhara: well why isnt it
[12:03:00]  truesque: it is WIDESADGE
[12:03:14]  bunhara: conflicting information
[12:03:23]  truesque: this game is about uncertainty bun
[12:03:33]  captainfalcum: troosk pls save the dumb takes for @bunhara
[12:03:35]  nerdbusta1: @truesque fusion hammer looks like an upside hammer to me
[12:03:47]  truesque: it is an upside down hammer
[12:03:50]  truesque: but I never saw that
[12:03:50]  moneymoneyloot: i would not use that thing to set a nail
[12:04:09]  truesque: I always thought it was just like the fire that came up from a forge when you were using the hammer or something
[12:04:16]  moneymoneyloot: worst hammer I've ever seen
[12:04:19]  truesque: my day is ruined
[12:04:22]  bunhara: well duh
[12:04:29]  bunhara: thats why you cant upgrade with it @moneymoneyloot
[12:04:34]  bunhara: stupid
[12:04:39]  muirthemne: makes sense
[12:04:40]  truesque: wait
[12:04:46]  captainfalcum: !sr hammer time audio
[12:04:48]  nightbot: @CaptainFalcum -> "MC Hammer - U Can't Touch This (HQ)" by UselezzUtuber has been added to the queue in position #1
[12:04:48]  truesque: and you can't upgrade because you're using the hammer to fight
[12:04:52]  muirthemne: TPOG
[12:04:53]  truesque: rather than using the hammer to upgrade cards
[12:04:57]  truesque: why does it make so much sense
[12:04:59]  nerdbusta1: troosk actually could be right. A powerful force of energy so strong striking the ground and acting as a hammer
[12:05:00]  muirthemne: HOLY
[12:05:12]  bunhara: where does it imply you're using the hammer to fight
[12:05:21]  truesque: I just implied it @Bunhara
[12:05:24]  truesque: pay attention
[12:05:43]  bunhara: i just interpret it as it being too hot to use
[12:05:58]  bunhara: oh wait it says you cant let it go
[12:06:01]  truesque: Once wielded the owner can never let go
[12:06:05]  truesque: so you can't use it to upgrade
[12:06:06]  truesque: holy
[12:06:08]  truesque: I don't know
[12:06:17]  truesque: and harder to sleep
[12:06:17]  bunhara: that description fucking kirs
[12:06:19]  truesque: holding the hammer
[12:06:19]  bunhara: lies
[12:06:29]  moneymoneyloot: kirs
[12:06:29]  bunhara: you can lose it to nloth
[12:06:33]  bunhara: and you lose it on death
[12:06:37]  moneymoneyloot: NECEO
[12:06:38]  bunhara: therefore it can be let go
[12:06:42]  bunhara: whats the fucking truth
[12:07:02]  captainnoobzor: @truesque well that doesnt make sense
[12:07:05]  bunhara: @moneymoneyloot carl sr will die by my hand
[12:07:07]  captainnoobzor: you use a hammer to smith
[12:07:10]  jguest05: this relic has more meaning than me
[12:07:16]  truesque: @captainnoobzor exactly
[12:07:19]  truesque: so why can't you upgrade
[12:07:34]  truesque: or is it because you can't pick up the smithing hammer
[12:07:36]  bunhara: fusion hammer fucking sucks it makes no sense
[12:07:47]  truesque: i hate fusion hammer now
[12:07:53]  truesque: I will never pick it again
[12:07:54]  muirthemne: D:
[12:07:56]  captainnoobzor: fusion hammer should let you fuse cards instead of upgrading them
[12:08:02]  truesque: holy
[12:08:03]  bunhara: TRUE
[12:08:04]  truesque: that would be sick
[12:08:08]  bunhara: oh god
[12:08:09]  its_goddy: it's a smithing hammer.  shouldn't it benefit you at rest sites??
[12:08:12]  bunhara: i want to play soire with friends
[12:08:17]  muirthemne: more like False Advertising Hammer
[12:08:20]  captainnoobzor: i upgrade defend and strike into iron wave at the rest site
[12:08:38]  its_goddy: @bunhara would love a team versus, i'd be down
[12:08:43]  apneaa: event that turn all strikes and defends to 5 ironwaves

[12:08:51]  bunhara: ive never played the versus mode
[12:08:58]  bunhara: i just like playing with the fuse cards
[12:09:06]  muirthemne: maybe you traded your useful upgrade hammer for a cool Weeb Hammer
[12:09:16]  muirthemne: it gives u inspiration and energy
[12:09:25]  muirthemne: but no good for actual hammering
[12:09:28]  bunhara: i think its just bingo?

[12:16:52]  captainnoobzor: to make sure that you need a fusion hammer in order to play it
[12:17:00]  truesque: bludgeon should cost 1 less for each attack you've played this combat
[12:17:00]  bunhara: holy
[12:17:23]  bunhara: bludgeon should cost 1 more for each attack youve played this combat
