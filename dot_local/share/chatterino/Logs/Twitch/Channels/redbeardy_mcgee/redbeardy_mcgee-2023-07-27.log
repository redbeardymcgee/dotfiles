[13:14:56]  bunhara: @firstdane you're amazing, bun
[13:15:06]  muirthemne: sy1vieWOW
[13:15:39]  glint0: GOOD MUSIC
[13:15:42]  bunhara: it's not really anything to learn tbh. i just ripped some assets from the game, resized em, moved em around, erased, etc
[13:15:43]  glint0: baalorJam
[13:15:49]  99percentsneaky: bag-o'-pog catYep
[13:15:51]  firstdane: every time i try to make emotes i spend 6 hours on what ends up being a stick figure

[13:16:12]  firstdane: complete artistic void over here
[13:16:21]  glint0: MAWBBERS is peak emote
[13:16:21]  leprochauninja: I did make a bunch of cards into easy to use emotes at one time
[13:16:37]  bunhara: its also still hard to compare to a monster like apneaa
[13:17:01]  bunhara: HUGE RUPTURE VALUE
[13:17:21]  leprochauninja: I can get the drive link folder for that if people want it
[13:17:23]  nerdbusta1: Apneaa was streaming making an emote for Cheg0. That was pretty interesting
[13:17:47]  bunhara: they always wanna cum
[13:18:48]  99percentsneaky: but they never want a leaf
[13:18:58]  bunhara: dkShame
[13:19:29]  bunhara: what if it does hurt
[13:20:25]  99percentsneaky: weird...a seed with only 1 number....feels rare
[13:20:27]  ruah777: this draws been trash
[13:20:36]  ruah777: wow

[13:21:02]  apneaa: bunhara is the best spire emote artist but she is lazier than me
[13:21:02]  bunhara: no no, painful is cycle 4
[13:21:44]  bunhara: there is truth within thise words
[13:22:01]  bunhara: 4 potions used, and still not 100 damage done
[13:22:26]  glint0: monkaS
[13:22:52]  glint0: brimstone problems
[13:23:00]  apneaa: also the "twitch chat dark mode color background" mode for spire
[13:23:06]  apneaa: was made for me by jerrylicious
[13:23:13]  bunhara: right, right
[13:23:21]  bunhara: i just remember you introducing it to me
[13:23:22]  apneaa: i did come up with the idea
[13:23:27]  apneaa: but jerry executed
[13:23:36]  bunhara: as be always does Kreygasm
[13:24:25]  apneaa: what that mod mean is that some of my emotes might look worse on light theme twich
[13:24:26]  apneaa: but
[13:24:46]  apneaa: users that use lightmode dont deserve to have good looking emotes
[13:24:50]  apneaa: DansGame
[13:24:57]  bunhara: true!
[13:25:14]  nerdbusta1: I use light mode u.u

[13:25:40]  glint0: g g
[13:26:21]  leprochauninja: it wasn't infinite it only lasted a few minutes
[13:26:21]  bunhara: claims to be apathetic playing the watxher, yet goes infinite on the ironclad in the heart. curious.
[13:27:56]  duncanarchib: multi-deck archetype drifting very nice
[13:28:21]  nerdbusta1: Did you pick up the True grit specifically for the infinite?
[13:29:00]  nerdbusta1: I think you took in Act 3
[13:29:09]  nerdbusta1: And then upgraded immediately
[13:29:10]  bunhara: there is a giant orb in the sky that you are not allowed to make direct eye contact with and you dont question that? 🐑
[13:29:45]  ruah777: did we just exhaust down to infinite?
[13:30:03]  ruah777: fair enough
[13:30:05]  muirthemne: @bunhara TheIlluminati
[13:30:14]  bunhara: TheIlluminati
[13:30:14]  ruah777: it looked like our str was just good enough
[13:30:19]  firstdane: beardy do you have a guide on how to do multiple audio sources to avoid music going to vods?
[13:30:33]  ruah777: yea this is a deck that just races to the end
[13:30:44]  bunhara: beardy will come to your house personally and teach you
[13:30:59]  nerdbusta1: I ask about the true grit because I almost never pick up the card. I feel like I may be underrating the card
[13:31:15]  bunhara: i think true grit is both overrated and underrated
