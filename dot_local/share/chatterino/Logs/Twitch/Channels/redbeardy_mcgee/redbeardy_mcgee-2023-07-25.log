[11:32:54]  mmg1590: Hello!
[11:42:54]  surrealistic_ganerson: @Redbeardy_McGee can you come up with a smart combination of words?
[11:44:03]  surrealistic_ganerson: Indubitably sounds more old fashioned than smart tho, doesn't it?
[11:45:16]  surrealistic_ganerson: Old fashioned isn't a bad thing in my opinion tbh
[11:58:38]  phrogamid: BIGFROG
[11:59:13]  phrogamid: i saw your title and my first thought was 'how do you draw a game of slay the spire'
[12:03:20]  phrogamid: !song
[12:03:20]  nightbot: @phrogamid -> "Andrew Combs - "Reptilia" [The Strokes Cover]" by New West Records is the current song. It was requested by Redbeardy_McGee - https://youtu.be/BlJuufKzvlY
[12:03:56]  phrogamid: it's p cool yeah
[12:04:56]  surrealistic_ganerson: Can a cover ever be better than the original?
[12:05:49]  phrogamid: sure
[12:06:34]  surrealistic_ganerson: what's bad wolkves?
[12:06:54]  phrogamid: i personally don't like it but birdy's cover of skinny love seems to be widely considered better than bon iver's original
[12:06:59]  redbeardy_mcgee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XaS93WMRQQ
[12:08:16]  surrealistic_ganerson: I guess it depends on what you consider the song, makes sense that the emotions attached to the song matter a lot
