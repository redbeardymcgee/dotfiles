[08:40:33]  moneymoneyloot: rare is okayish but lose all gold is gigacringe
[08:40:40]  nerdbusta1: Defect loves money more than rare cards I think
[08:40:52]  moneymoneyloot: 7 max is pog fucking champion
[08:41:12]  drdeathnite: 7hp is basically a relic
[08:41:25]  moneymoneyloot: colorless is not terrible but if u skip you'll wish you had 7 max
[08:41:38]  moneymoneyloot: shackles and instincts and blind are great
[08:41:42]  nerdbusta1: defect is a colorless card enthusiast
[08:41:50]  moneymoneyloot: panic button good

[08:42:31]  apneaa: no idea
[08:42:34]  apneaa: but it's good
[08:42:36]  moribund: have you considered the abandon run option
[08:42:38]  nerdbusta1: max hp seems good if we plan on going for that super aggressive path and resting
[08:42:57]  moneymoneyloot: fr I think 7 max is underrated and underpicked
[08:43:00]  moneymoneyloot: it's boring but good
[08:43:13]  apneaa: money is the 7 max enjoyer
[08:43:26]  moneymoneyloot: i think baalor likes max too
[08:43:37]  moneymoneyloot: on aggro paths

[08:44:38]  enriqueque: Hello! It makes me happy you're streaming again...you did take some time off right?
[08:44:45]  drdeathnite: calculated, never not had it
[08:45:01]  tipereth6: I miss being a homie
[08:45:11]  shmooooz: but we  miss the beard cam
[08:45:14]  shmooooz: just saying :D
[08:45:28]  enriqueque: Would you like to hear an awful joke?
[08:45:29]  shmooooz: wow, tipereth got the homie status liek nothing ;D
[08:45:59]  enriqueque: The other night my wife and I went to dinner at this place that specializes in cooking meats that are typically discarded. We ordered the beef tongue and beef tripe. Unfortunately the dish only arrived with the meat on it, no veggies or starches or anything. It was just offal!
[08:46:26]  moribund: 🤔
[08:46:36]  shmooooz: first mistake: going out with your wife :D
[08:46:48]  its_goddy: first off, tripe is delicious
[08:46:50]  moneymoneyloot: hello dub
[08:47:00]  shmooooz: yeah, she regrets it daily
[08:47:19]  tipereth6: beef tongue can be amazing if prepped well, or stewed
[08:47:23]  drdeathnite: am i crazy for thinking hello world is not bad here?
[08:47:40]  moneymoneyloot: hello world v solid
[08:47:43]  moribund: Hello World is pretty rad in act 1
[08:47:45]  shmooooz: i think it was kind of an altruistic move when marrying me... like a good deed of the day project

[08:49:40]  captainfalcum: As you all know, I have been consistently streaming my gameplay for quite some time now, and I have always aimed to provide an accurate representation of my performance in the game. However, due to some unexpected circumstances, I have decided that my next "run" will not be included in my winrate sample.
[08:49:40]  moribund: CNET should have wrapped it up years ago
[08:49:43]  moneymoneyloot: nah im with you
[08:49:55]  moribund: relic from Web 1.0
[08:50:18]  shmooooz: i am all for ai doing the boring mental work... its a problem of how we distribute the wealth that is generated from that
[08:50:29]  skippygoober: we wont
[08:50:30]  moribund: yeah CNET used to be a reliable place for freeware if I remember correctly
[08:50:31]  skippygoober: kekw
[08:50:48]  captainfalcum: WALL-E
[08:50:54]  skippygoober: the wealth generated by it will go to the business owners who fired all the humans and replaced them with bots
[08:51:19]  shmooooz: but also i hear a lot of people talking that we could reach a real identiy crisis with AI... even if all people get universal income, it could still ruin their lives.. not doing anything
[08:51:26]  skippygoober: like beardy says, capitalism is the root cause of the issue
[08:51:29]  skippygoober: not the technology
[08:51:45]  moneymoneyloot: ive been not doing anything for years its awesome
[08:51:53]  captainfalcum: doing nothing can be hard for some
[08:51:55]  moneymoneyloot: can't be replaced
[08:52:06]  muirthemne: What are u doing step baldr?
[08:52:12]  captainfalcum: but yeah it's kinda pog too
[08:52:13]  moneymoneyloot: hell yeah
[08:52:24]  shmooooz: @moneymoneyloot lving of the sweet crypto money? D:
[08:52:28]  captainfalcum: everyone's moving in with mml
[08:52:34]  moneymoneyloot: something like that
[08:52:41]  tipereth6: in warm enough climates Yurts can be great
[08:52:54]  muirthemne: A yurtamid?
[08:53:03]  tipereth6: I live in WA state and living in Yurts are brutal for most of the year
[08:53:25]  captainfalcum: finding passion and fulfillment without work Kreygasm
[08:54:01]  shmooooz: I think a lot of people need a structure and something resembling work to fell fulfillment
[08:54:18]  muirthemne: Yayayas sy1vieAYAYAH
[08:54:24]  shmooooz: you sure?
[08:54:41]  shmooooz: most people I know that dont work hang around social media, netflix and are terrible
[08:54:45]  shmooooz: even if they are financially set
[08:55:34]  moneymoneyloot: what do u mean by terrible
[08:55:57]  skippygoober: money defending his people
[08:55:59]  skippygoober: LUL
[08:56:06]  shmooooz: they are not truly filling happy and like their lives... they are more existing than living
[08:56:08]  tipereth6: also, twitch chat is a form of 'social media' so welcome to the machine
[08:56:38]  shmooooz: I guess it depends a lot on the mental state of people
[08:56:43]  moneymoneyloot: is that your perspective or theirs
[08:57:03]  moneymoneyloot: and what is really the cause there
[08:57:21]  shmooooz: well, from people looking from the outside and some of them also say so... not all though
[08:57:28]  skippygoober: I work for a living and I dont feel like I have a fulfilling life
[08:58:15]  captainfalcum: moneym59JACKIE
[08:58:23]  skippygoober: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs
[08:58:26]  skippygoober: all work today
[08:58:26]  shmooooz: maybe its just they miss a structure to their lives?
[08:58:56]  shmooooz: I think quite a lot do actually
[08:58:57]  moneymoneyloot: it sounds like you need structure and are imposing that on others
[08:58:59]  captainfalcum: maybe all they've ever be3n constructed is "structure"
[08:59:00]  tipereth6: what do you consider structure Shmooooz?
[08:59:21]  tipereth6: the nomenclature I feel is defined very differently based on a lot of relative norms
[08:59:41]  enriqueque: People enjoy feeling validated in some way, completing tasks at a job and then getting paid for it, then awarding others with that money are multiple layers of validation
[08:59:49]  shmooooz: not saying everybody needs that... its just what I see from some people
[08:59:59]  muirthemne: DinoDance brioBounce DinoDance brioBounce DinoDance
[09:00:38]  skippygoober: but under capitalism all forms of validation are cash driven
[09:00:46]  skippygoober: C.R.E.A.M.
[09:01:02]  enriqueque: Did you know that magenta is a color that does not exist on the wavelength spectrum?
[09:01:28]  captainfalcum: purple Kreygasm
[09:01:35]  muirthemne: Purple is pog
[09:01:36]  shmooooz: I heard Sam Harris saying something along the line: everybody who works wants to go on holiday and do nothing... but when you give it to them, never ending holiday, they hate it and want to pay to get away from the holiday they previously paid to go to haha
[09:01:49]  moneymoneyloot: lol
[09:01:58]  bunhara: purple names WutFace
[09:02:04]  moneymoneyloot: sam harris is a smart guy who is extremely disconnected from what most people actually want
[09:02:16]  enriqueque: Magenta is basically "not green"
[09:02:34]  shmooooz: I am  not saying he is right... just somebody who had a similar feeling than i did for some people
[09:02:40]  enriqueque: There are dozens of us purple-named users! Dozens!
[09:03:11]  captainfalcum: moneym59JACKIE
[09:03:12]  shmooooz: yeah he goes to the extremes quite quickly haha
[09:03:25]  captainfalcum: doo doo
[09:03:35]  muirthemne: coxDantan
[09:04:12]  captainfalcum: and also people are generally not wealthy enough to do a lot if they happen to get free time
[09:04:45]  tipereth6: Cat Jam
[09:05:09]  captainfalcum: so they're "forced" to just sit around and watch Netflix or sleep all day for a month or two
[09:05:38]  captainfalcum: and not saying there's anything wrong with that bc some can do that forever and enjoy it
[09:05:43]  stupidketchup: howdy glgl

[09:06:18]  muirthemne: Pikmin died for your sins
[09:06:43]  shmooooz: but i want everyone to be happy :D I just think for some people not having work as a fixed thing in their world will be hard to adapt to
[09:06:53]  shmooooz: for others it would be the greatest blessing and freedom
[09:07:20]  tipereth6: I am of the opinion, that Happiness and seeking it as an absolute is inherently a flawed set of values
[09:07:30]  stupidketchup: i love my job. i just wish it wasn't 40+ hours of my week LUL

[09:10:43]  nerdbusta1: To buy a potion for the elite
[09:10:44]  drdeathnite: i did that once in spelunky
[09:10:46]  captainfalcum: inciting violence
[09:10:53]  bunhara: pokemon mystery dungeon did that
[09:10:54]  moneymoneyloot: i wish i could shoot the merchant
[09:10:54]  drdeathnite: shopkeeper killed me in 3 microseconds
[09:10:58]  captainfalcum: the kids are looting bc of it
[09:11:01]  stupidketchup: i like it when you can rob the shopkeepers and they'll kick your butt
[09:11:03]  moribund: PETTHEMERCHANT
[09:11:14]  shmooooz: @moneymoneyloot at least with the mod you can attack him :D
[09:11:36]  tipereth6: Zelda Oracle of Seasons/Ages is the first game I know of that you can rob the shop keeper in

[09:14:09]  moribund: didn't use the static electricity strat dkShame
[09:14:49]  moribund: I fell off Zelda games hard because I despised Majora's Mask and Windwaker

[09:17:07]  moribund: and there's a RIDICULOUS padded section near the end that requires like... at least 4000 rupees or something insane
[09:17:14]  enriqueque: When I first played Majora's Mask, I was pretty young and was only allowed to play video games in 30 minute increments. It takes about an hour to get to the point where you can actually save for the first time
[09:17:21]  moribund: yeah HD added a fast sail
[09:17:33]  moribund: and it made the Tingle quest less awful
[09:17:57]  shmooooz: when you learned the occarina songs :D was real great back then
[09:18:22]  enriqueque: You can't owl statue save until you're Link

[09:18:26]  drdeathnite: yeah, you have to do a tutorial dungeon before you get to town
[09:18:33]  drdeathnite: and it takes sometime
[09:18:34]  enriqueque: Gotta bop them feathery fucks with a sword
[09:18:50]  moribund: the padded quest in WW is having Tingle identify map pieces. it's about 400 rupees and there's at least 8 of them
[09:18:55]  enriqueque: You need to get the ocarina after the first full 3 day cycle

[09:20:25]  moribund: yes
[09:20:28]  moribund: it is 100% required
[09:20:46]  moribund: there's some other quest line he has that is optional and involves the GBA or something.
[09:21:14]  tipereth6: its notorious for long JRPGS especially
[09:21:21]  moribund: people used to really demand that games take at least 30 hours to beat
[09:21:24]  tipereth6: that breakdown
[09:21:37]  moribund: that was a big thing for a while. An expectation that games are loaded with content to make them worht $60
[09:22:02]  tipereth6: Even Baldur's Gate 3 has that similar issue
[09:22:28]  moribund: no spoilies
[09:22:35]  moribund: did you play Divinity Original Sin
[09:22:37]  tipereth6: oh of course
[09:22:46]  tipereth6: Act 3 stands out as very distinct to the rest of Act 2 or 1
[09:23:06]  moribund: just play co-op :)
[09:23:11]  moribund: everything is better in co-op
[09:23:32]  enriqueque: You can also play as a barrelmancer, which is quite simple
[09:23:54]  drdeathnite: in divinity 2
[09:24:10]  drdeathnite: you could do that
[09:24:17]  tipereth6: If you tried hard enough you could be a Barrelmancer in BG3 lol
[09:24:18]  drdeathnite: or just stack a chest full of shit
[09:24:19]  enriqueque: Telekinesis has no weight limit, just a distance limit
[09:24:22]  drdeathnite: and bludgeon them with it
[09:24:37]  enriqueque: You can find several indestructible chests, then you just put EVERYTHING in them
[09:24:38]  drdeathnite: and damage is based on the weight of the chest, so you could scale it with how much shit you have
[09:25:02]  enriqueque: You just have to watch out for some enemies that have the ability to reflect damage back to you
[09:25:19]  moribund: I think the speedrun squishes things with barrels and chests a lot
[09:25:23]  moribund: or it did at some point, at least
[09:25:35]  drdeathnite: the engine allows you to stack stuff and climb over
[09:26:20]  drdeathnite: speedrunners know the route so they can do it fast, casually its just tedious or you do it when you run out of options
[09:27:00]  tipereth6: Nob is QUITE the problem right now

[13:05:28]  apneaa: arent they named
[13:05:30]  apneaa: different
[13:05:32]  apneaa: for other characters
[13:05:38]  apneaa: i thought only cloud had it named limit break
[13:05:47]  apneaa: i have no idea
[13:05:51]  moribund: they're all limit breaks in FF8
[13:05:55]  apneaa: ohhhh
[13:05:56]  apneaa: 8
[13:05:58]  moribund: but it's called something else for each character
[13:05:59]  apneaa: sorry
[13:06:09]  bahbkarns: Each character had limit breaks, just different names
[13:06:14]  bahbkarns: But they were limit breaks
[13:06:14]  duncanarchib: ff6 was my favorite game, then ff7 was amazing, then ff8 and i've never played the series again lol
[13:06:15]  moribund: Squall is Renzokuken, Zell is Duel, Sophie is Slots
[13:06:16]  moribund: etc
[13:06:24]  moribund: Selphie*
[13:06:42]  moribund: 8 and 9 are my favorites by far
[13:06:43]  bahbkarns: tactics is the best final fantasy, prove me wrong
[13:06:46]  moribund: but they're also the first two I played
[13:06:47]  apneaa: i played one spin off from 12 on ds
[13:06:49]  apneaa: it was so bad
[13:06:52]  apneaa: i sent it back
[13:06:53]  apneaa: lul

[13:06:59]  apneaa: LUL
[13:07:11]  apneaa: meanwhile tactics Kreygasm
[13:07:17]  duncanarchib: you should check out the earlier ones moribund
[13:07:34]  apneaa: ff4 is the only regular line ff i played
[13:07:38]  apneaa: the music is so good
[13:07:42]  moribund: I played FF6
[13:08:07]  moribund: and I tried a few earlier ones but I don't know if i finished them. I know I definitely didn't finish the NES games. A little too dated for me
[13:08:20]  moribund: and I got bored during the tutorial for tactics
[13:08:34]  apneaa: @moribund youre not supposed
[13:08:37]  apneaa: to read the tutorial
[13:08:39]  moribund: I'm too impatient in my sunset years
[13:08:45]  apneaa: theres no tactics in tactics
[13:08:48]  duncanarchib: just go to that forest up in the top right corner that's all t-rex's and you can level up everyone super fast if you don't like the grind
[13:09:03]  apneaa: it's the least strategic strategy game on earth
[13:09:07]  apneaa: it's more the clan management
[13:09:10]  apneaa: thats good
[13:09:23]  apneaa: it's like being a boss
[13:09:27]  apneaa: and you are managing the team
[13:09:30]  apneaa: very fun
[13:09:47]  apneaa: oh i need to be there on the 8th of whatever the hell month in the ff calendar
[13:09:50]  apneaa: but i also have to be here
[13:09:58]  apneaa: and on the 9 of whatever
[13:10:11]  apneaa: lets take this road because theres an encounter on the way
[13:10:15]  apneaa: and then stop by this city
[13:10:15]  moribund: the Steam remasters for 8 and 9 have handy QoL tools
[13:10:23]  apneaa: for the meterial for this character i just picked up
[13:10:28]  duncanarchib: do they get rid of the junctioning system?
[13:10:30]  bahbkarns: 9 is getting a legit remake too, pretty hype for that
[13:10:32]  apneaa: it's a very fun management
[13:10:37]  bahbkarns: not just the HD update
[13:10:37]  apneaa: but the actual fights?
[13:10:39]  apneaa: broken
[13:10:48]  apneaa: you get so absurdly op
[13:10:48]  moribund: no, but I think you can give yourself 99 of every magic or something like that?
[13:11:06]  duncanarchib: that'd go a long way
[13:11:23]  apneaa: @moribund every single fight in tactics is winnable by pressing a repeatedly and moving your characters into a range to attack
[13:11:30]  apneaa: with absolutly no thought whatsoever
[13:11:32]  moribund: I don't doubt it
[13:11:37]  apneaa: given you have managed your team decently
[13:11:43]  moribund: but I think I reached minute 5 of just having to stare at the game playing itself
[13:11:47]  moribund: and I said "fuck this" and turned it off
[13:12:00]  apneaa: did you do the og or the second one
[13:12:02]  apneaa: @moribund
[13:12:20]  moribund: the one for PSX which I think is the OG?
[13:12:26]  apneaa: it is
[13:12:43]  apneaa: the second one has a much shorter tutorial and get you going into the story very fast
[13:13:31]  moribund: I may revisit it at some point
[13:14:32]  apneaa: tactics are funny in that
[13:14:34]  apneaa: you actually cant
[13:14:36]  apneaa: 100%
[13:14:40]  apneaa: your first go through
[13:14:43]  apneaa: LUL
[13:14:51]  moribund: I played through 9 earlier this year. It's really good, but the ending is... not good
[13:14:55]  apneaa: just because of the way you have to manage time
[13:14:57]  sycocell: yeah 9 is the only ff i haven't played due to similar circumstances (having to borrow, etc)
[13:15:01]  apneaa: to be able to do all the missions
[13:15:42]  apneaa: i forgot
[13:15:46]  sycocell: 8 is my favorite and they shun it every chance they get
[13:15:49]  apneaa: what was controversial about ff9 ending
[13:15:53]  sycocell: no 8 got a remaster, it's not getting a remake
[13:15:53]  apneaa: i know some dont like it
[13:16:08]  moribund: I'm only aware of the FF7 remake. I wasn't aware of any other remakes
[13:16:09]  sparklecrotchthottie: dont cry beardy
[13:16:09]  apneaa: what is the story of 8?
[13:16:10]  bahbkarns: 9 remake is supposed to be faithful mechanics wise, but total graphical overhaul instead of just scaled
[13:16:13]  apneaa: i've never heard about it
[13:16:49]  bahbkarns: 9 ending / final boss was just kind of like "Oh, well this is a thing"
[13:18:44]  apneaa: no one want to tell me about ff8 :/
[13:18:53]  apneaa: i guess i'll look through a summary on youtube
[13:18:55]  apneaa: dkShame
[13:19:07]  bahbkarns: nobody knows how the story for 8 is supposed to go
[13:19:15]  bahbkarns: It's just very all over the place
[13:19:32]  captainfalcum: seven ate nein hehe
[13:19:35]  bahbkarns: 9 got an upscale
[13:19:35]  duncanarchib: i don't know the story for 8 cause i never finished it
[13:20:25]  sycocell: @Apneaa 8 = you're a student becoming a mercenary for a military group called SeeD and in your training/adventures you get wrapped up in a plot to destroy the world and you save it. that's the most simple version because it gets VERY convoluted toward the end
[13:20:39]  moneymoneyloot: 8 had the best card game
[13:20:43]  moribund: hell yes
[13:20:48]  sycocell: @moneymoneyloot this is factual
[13:20:49]  moribund: Triple Triad
[13:20:59]  moribund: 9 had Tetra Master which is g a r b a g e
[13:21:17]  paparatto18: can you kill it
[13:21:24]  moneymoneyloot: pogpa

[13:23:35]  sycocell: @Apneaa LMAO yeah that's why i kept it simple. because when you actually get into the story it can be hard to keep track. the last disc of that game = woof story-wise
[13:23:40]  duncanarchib: flower setup tho
[13:24:04]  moribund: all Final Fantasy plots are borderline nonsensical
[13:24:08]  sycocell: ^
[13:24:08]  apneaa: i found a 13 min shortened video
[13:24:11]  moribund: 8 is especially ridiculous

[13:28:41]  sycocell: @Apneaa still my favorite tho i can admit the story is sus. it's the first FF i ever bought myself and first FF i ever beat w/o my brother's help. nostalgia strong
[13:28:51]  moribund: I love the story in ff8 even though it's dumb as hell
[13:28:54]  apneaa: @SycoCell it look like it's more character based as always
[13:28:58]  apneaa: and the story is just there
[13:28:59]  paparatto18: Adge
[13:29:07]  sycocell: @Apneaa that's a very good way to put it
[13:29:19]  apneaa: ff is just character focus and something absolutly nonsensical is going on behind as usual
[13:29:23]  apneaa: oh and memory loss
[13:29:40]  apneaa: a ff game GOT to have some memory loss

[13:32:00]  theyarejo: I’m obsessed with it. It’s the first game I’ve been addicted to in probably 5 years other than STS.
[13:32:13]  moribund: @firstdane actually it's the Divinity engine

[13:36:09]  moneymoneyloot: green key act 1 is heaven
[13:36:10]  nerdbusta1: I over extend but I’m a go next monkey anyway
[13:37:44]  nerdbusta1: happy flower is sad
[13:38:03]  paparatto18: the secret to the game is that everyone but silent owns in act 1
[13:38:10]  paparatto18: and silent sometimes owns in act 1
[13:38:12]  firstdane: firdHAPPY
[13:39:01]  moneymoneyloot: defect owns
[13:39:18]  nerdbusta1: @paparatto18 I had a clad run recently where I took 4 elites plus dead adventurer
[13:39:24]  nerdbusta1: Act 1 is for babies

[13:39:54]  moneymoneyloot: i love the rbt vry pwrfl chrctr
[13:40:05]  paparatto18: clad takes one anger and solos 5 elites
[13:40:16]  paparatto18: silent takes 5 attacks and dies to floor 6 laga
[13:40:20]  nerdbusta1: Also floor 1 clothesline owns
[13:40:26]  paparatto18: it's ok
[13:40:33]  paparatto18: clad owns so it owns
[13:40:35]  nerdbusta1: Anger is pog

[13:46:17]  moribund: 27 gold
[13:50:08]  ruah777: i honestly think pretty hard on the flex to try to get seed str
[13:53:15]  ruah777: i see our block plan is reaper
[13:54:33]  ruah777: wait
[13:54:39]  ruah777: did we get gig combo
[13:54:42]  ruah777: like
[13:54:44]  ruah777: legit
[13:54:48]  moribund: FeelsGoodMan
[13:54:50]  ruah777: its play card get 1 str
[13:54:56]  ruah777: 2 str
[13:55:05]  ruah777: yea
[13:55:18]  ruah777: yea that is oddly the hi roll
[13:55:27]  ruah777: only way it can be better is if we had cube
[13:55:34]  ruah777: i just key for flexiblity
[13:55:47]  firstdane: dont want the second wind upgrade?
[13:56:10]  ruah777: i think with how much we can face tank that second wind upgrade is not that important
[13:56:29]  ruah777: our game plan is just dont die, make tons of str, reaper and feed
[13:56:34]  firstdane: seems like a good hedge and a card that will be used to thin out the deck anyway
[13:56:41]  ruah777: maybe
[13:56:48]  ruah777: i dont think its critcal right now
[13:57:31]  ruah777: question now is if we get off the feed
[13:57:46]  ruah777: looking hard
[13:58:11]  ruah777: wow
[13:58:13]  ruah777: the feed too?
[13:58:23]  ruah777: that is a little luck

[14:24:35]  nerdbusta1: hand drill deck Kreygasm
[14:25:20]  nerdbusta1: Is there ever a legitimate reason to buy hand drill other than having too much gold?
[14:25:38]  nerdbusta1: pretty sure that’s the only reason I’ve bought the relic
[14:25:40]  ruah777: honestly this shop is kind of a bust
[14:25:48]  moneymoneyloot: i had it pop off vs champ with champ belt recently
[14:25:53]  moneymoneyloot: the run lost but it was cool
[14:26:28]  ruah777: take drill to maybe take to get one artifact off?
[14:26:34]  ruah777: like we dont have much value
[14:26:41]  ruah777: its bad
[14:26:42]  ruah777: but like

[14:27:25]  nerdbusta1: I just think there are relics that should have gotten buffs. Im never like “fuck yeah, hand drill is here”
[14:27:29]  ruah777: but even with bad draws we are strong enough
[14:27:38]  ruah777: yea
[14:27:46]  ruah777: drill is so small of a buff
[14:27:50]  ruah777: too many fights it does nothing
