[16:18:37]  stepnine: oh sorry
[16:18:40]  leprochauninja: A(2)0
[16:18:44]  stepnine: how did you reset and keep a20?
[16:18:55]  leprochauninja: hacks
[16:19:02]  stepnine: i thought you deleted at the beginning
[16:19:11]  stepnine: all your profiles
[16:19:56]  apneaa: i deleted all my run histories
[16:20:00]  apneaa: for the xecnar files
[16:20:27]  apneaa: why move them when i can delete them?
[16:20:30]  apneaa: NOBAYRS
[16:20:52]  leprochauninja: saving them is a coward thought
[16:20:55]  apneaa: i know whats in there, i remember every run monkaS it's not like there was much to begin win
[16:22:02]  apneaa: beardy while you were gone i finished the coach adventure, i streamed a total of 250 coach vods monkaS
[16:22:30]  apneaa: a lot
[16:22:31]  apneaa: massive
[16:22:42]  apneaa: i cant even begin
[16:22:48]  apneaa: i dont have nothing to deliver
[16:22:51]  apneaa: because one thing happened
[16:22:55]  apneaa: xecnar started playing clad
[16:23:05]  apneaa: and then all of a sudden i had nothing to do with clad anymore
[16:23:58]  apneaa: i wanted someone to go beyond coach because i knew clad had some more ambitions in him
[16:24:02]  apneaa: xec did that
[16:24:20]  apneaa: turn out if you dont throw with clad and you are a perfect player
[16:24:26]  apneaa: hitting a 90 in a sample
[16:24:29]  apneaa: is already doable

[16:25:26]  apneaa: then i did an analysis of xecnar 100 and compared it to coach last 100 with a few stats
[16:25:57]  apneaa: xecnar didnt do 90 but if you take his sample and you remove the throws it's 90 already
[16:26:02]  apneaa: so 90 is already doable
[16:26:11]  apneaa: not even talking that above 90 is also doable
[16:27:30]  apneaa: so yeah i'm done with clad, i figured it out
[16:27:34]  apneaa: the secret with clad is
[16:27:38]  apneaa: "do what xecnar is doing"
[16:27:48]  apneaa: because he's got it pretty good
[16:28:02]  apneaa: pitor acompagnied me a lot near the end
[16:28:37]  apneaa: i got some fairly recurring viewcount near the end
[16:28:57]  apneaa: i had like 4 chatters for the last 50
[16:29:05]  apneaa: everyone was just missing LC
[16:29:12]  apneaa: peoples were happy to just hear his voice

[16:30:52]  apneaa: @Redbeardy_McGee did you catch anything about the LC merl thingie?
[16:31:04]  apneaa: basicly were gonna have a watcher player with a jester hat
[16:31:11]  apneaa: proclaiming the other as king of watcher
[16:31:15]  apneaa: once one hit 50
[16:31:33]  apneaa: yes
[16:31:40]  apneaa: it started with just LC
[16:31:45]  apneaa: but merl showed up
[16:31:51]  apneaa: and LC couldn't resit
[16:31:53]  leprochauninja: it's okay
[16:31:55]  apneaa: giving him a challenge

[16:33:25]  apneaa: OH
[16:33:33]  apneaa: papa is doing rgbw
[16:33:36]  apneaa: only money
[16:33:36]  kurol__: Well xecnar should play some rotating near future
[16:33:39]  apneaa: is doing rgb
[16:33:45]  kurol__: So there is that
[16:33:46]  apneaa: i dont think it's fair btw
[16:33:54]  apneaa: LUL
[16:33:59]  apneaa: it's so much harder for money
[16:34:02]  apneaa: at 18rgb
[16:34:11]  kurol__: After his billion silent / defect sample
[16:34:19]  apneaa: xecnar want
[16:34:23]  apneaa: 150 more defect
[16:34:26]  apneaa: 100 silent
[16:34:29]  apneaa: and then rotating
[16:34:34]  apneaa: he is almost done with his current ones
[16:35:04]  apneaa: he will finish his current samples and then do 100 silent more
[16:35:07]  apneaa: do 50 defect swaps
[16:35:08]  kurol__: I mean I dont know
[16:35:12]  apneaa: (he has not swapped once)
[16:35:15]  kurol__: I dont count really
[16:35:17]  apneaa: and then a 100 defect
[16:35:22]  apneaa: he's close
[16:35:24]  apneaa: @KuroL__
[16:35:37]  kurol__: This Silent is probably going to be less than 80%
[16:35:51]  kurol__: The guy is trying out some silent stuff
[16:35:57]  apneaa: he has changed his macro
[16:36:00]  apneaa: the start was rough
[16:36:02]  apneaa: both rng wise
[16:36:06]  apneaa: and adapting to macro
[16:36:33]  apneaa: but now he's figured it out mostly
[16:36:48]  apneaa: notably he has figured out how to get amid every run since a week
[16:36:51]  apneaa: it's been good
[16:36:53]  apneaa: :D
[16:37:50]  moribund: 10 = 12

[16:40:01]  apneaa: there was an option
[16:40:02]  apneaa: to skip it
[16:40:08]  apneaa: they purposefully
[16:40:08]  apneaa: removed it
[16:40:25]  apneaa: byron and vms made a mod
[16:40:29]  apneaa: called ancient enemies

[16:43:15]  apneaa: i guess other big stuff is that the category died down for a while

[16:43:34]  muirthemne: moneyJAM
[16:43:35]  apneaa: there were days i was the only one of the "community" live
[16:43:48]  apneaa: money was gone, merl was gone, coach was gone, only xec remained
[16:44:10]  apneaa: papa was not there for a litttle while too
[16:44:26]  apneaa: i think everyone just needed a break from spire
[16:44:29]  apneaa: peoples did other games
[16:44:31]  muirthemne: amiss
[16:44:44]  apneaa: xecnar did slice and dice
[16:44:46]  apneaa: oh man

[16:50:00]  apneaa: no no
[16:50:05]  apneaa: after he was done with the 200
[16:50:08]  kurol__: Most of the Spire people coming to Slice is just at the top
[16:50:08]  apneaa: he slowed down a lot
[16:50:16]  kurol__: And then just dip
[16:50:18]  apneaa: he tried fairly hard on his individual 50's
[16:50:20]  apneaa: not mega long

Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

[18:38:44]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: he keeps playing in ways that can lose
[18:38:52]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i wonder if it will ever catch up to him

[18:39:42]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: if coach loses this streak i don't think it's happening this year
[18:40:21]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: the prodigal merl has abandoned
[18:40:37]  apneaa: i mean i have no idea who will take it
[18:40:53]  apneaa: but i'm fairly sure itwill happen
[18:40:58]  apneaa: the winrate is there for it
[18:41:14]  apneaa: coach did go 47-3 as like his first sample ever
[18:41:19]  apneaa: thats just the character
[18:41:29]  apneaa: if he stop throwing hard on floor 2
[18:41:33]  apneaa: he should be able to get it
[18:41:42]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: lc can do it for sure
[18:41:53]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: he plays like the highest quality combats in spire
[18:41:59]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: and his macro is obv solid
[18:42:04]  apneaa: but yeah lc play on watcher is like
[18:42:09]  apneaa: it's just the way he enjoy it
[18:42:11]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: but he sometimes just make mistake
[18:42:19]  vmservice: 39x2
[18:42:20]  vmservice: die
[18:42:37]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random well the thing is also that watcher is strong enough to handle the micro mistakes too
[18:42:46]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: usually
[18:42:49]  apneaa: thats what is dumb about watcher and clad to a lot of peoples
[18:42:51]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: that's why 50 is hard
[18:42:56]  apneaa: but yeah 50
[18:43:00]  apneaa: he gotta keep it under control
[18:43:04]  apneaa: today should have lost
[18:43:23]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: in the past week he's been in position to die more than 10% like three different times i think
[18:43:36]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: if that keeps happening it will probably die
[18:43:50]  apneaa: i've seen merl be in outcomes that had a lot more than that on his previous one too
[18:43:57]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: yeah
[18:44:01]  apneaa: and of course the loss for merl was like
[18:44:09]  apneaa: almost unavoidable
[18:44:13]  apneaa: from his way of play
[18:44:17]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: merl's 26 wasn't great play to his standards
[18:44:22]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: it wasn't 50-0 quality
[18:44:29]  apneaa: it was better than his previous streak
[18:44:34]  apneaa: by a decent margin still
[18:44:39]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i didn't watch his 38
[18:44:41]  apneaa: it's just not whathe know himself as
[18:45:03]  apneaa: like merl which he could perform at the best he can do today
[18:45:05]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i also just enjoy merl stream a lot
[18:45:08]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: he's a good streamer
[18:45:10]  apneaa: thats why he is deisapointed
[18:45:27]  apneaa: but compared to the way he was playing back then
[18:45:28]  vmservice: marl
[18:45:36]  apneaa: he is just better now
[18:46:05]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: apneaa is teh god of spire

[18:46:27]  apneaa: monkaS
[18:46:30]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: being immortal does that
[18:46:35]  kakistocraces: merl live when?
[18:46:59]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random just to be clear
[18:47:10]  apneaa: i highly agree that LC way of doing things will lead to a lot of deaths
[18:47:23]  apneaa: i just think it's sufficiently low enough
[18:47:28]  apneaa: that 50 is doable under a year
[18:47:33]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: i agree
[18:47:41]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: "this year" is only 5 months
[18:47:43]  apneaa: meanwhile merl might be a little better
[18:47:48]  apneaa: but he doesn't have the ability
[18:47:53]  apneaa: to pull out the hours for it
[18:47:56]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: so if this streak die i think it will take more than that
[18:47:59]  apneaa: and that just auto kills his shot
[18:48:15]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: lifecoach is a gamer
[18:48:16]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random eh this streak was built in less than two weeks tho
[18:48:19]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: to his core
[18:48:25]  apneaa: if coach doesn't take a long break
[18:48:27]  apneaa: it will happen
[18:48:40]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: maybe
[18:48:54]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: if he lose the streak i'll bet you a gifted sub to cheg0 on it
[18:49:08]  apneaa: @a_snail_chosen_at_random i think he will loose the actual like
[18:49:10]  apneaa: streak now
[18:49:11]  apneaa: LUL
[18:49:20]  apneaa: i think he still need to do a few more cycles
[18:49:42]  apneaa: coach is the kind of "throw" and "throw" and then take break and come back stronger style
[18:49:45]  a_snail_chosen_at_random: do you want to take the bet if the streak end?
[18:50:00]  apneaa: i dont do bets, i have no money
