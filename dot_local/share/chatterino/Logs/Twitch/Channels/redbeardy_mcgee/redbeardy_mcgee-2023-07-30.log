[12:52:07]  captainfalcum: 2020Gift
[13:00:44]  moribund: FeelsBeardMan
[13:02:19]  skippygoober: https://www.honest-broker.com/p/panic-among-the-streamers Pogamid
[13:02:41]  skippygoober: yee
[13:03:13]  skippygoober: "Netflix could buy 10 top quality screenplays per year with the cash they’ll spend on that one job.  They must have big plans for AI."
[13:03:21]  skippygoober: Pogamid
[13:04:06]  skippygoober: I shoulda been a Ai / machine learning major Sadge
[13:04:18]  skippygoober: 900k plus stocks
[13:05:41]  surrealistic_ganerson: I mean where else would they come from? I guess another possibility is from deep within the Earth or maybe if more than 3 dimensions exist, or maybe teleporting but that would still count as space imo
[13:06:09]  skippygoober: next you have to replace the real human actors with Ai actors because a human reading an Ai script can feel the cognitive dissonance
[13:06:40]  surrealistic_ganerson: My take on the question of where aliens would come if they did
[13:06:53]  skippygoober: yeah it is all large language models at the moment but Ai right now is not generalized ai intelligence
[13:07:57]  moribund: I'm an alien.
[13:08:00]  surrealistic_ganerson: There's like a super small chance? not worth discussing but maybe possible
[13:08:10]  moribund: currently stuck in the first of nine ads Sadge
[13:08:22]  captainnoobzor: red birdy
[13:08:37]  surrealistic_ganerson: If there must be 2 there must be more
[13:08:55]  bunhara: you're talking to me
[13:09:11]  bunhara: no i just joined GIGACHAD
[13:09:34]  surrealistic_ganerson: ads on livestream platforms that stop the livestream are no bueno for real
[13:10:03]  surrealistic_ganerson: You get an ad for joining the stream too
[13:10:05]  bunhara: they probably caught that yeah
[13:10:10]  skippygoober: why don't they do like banner ads so you can see and hear the stream while the ad is a banner on the screen?
[13:10:19]  bunhara: @skippygoober they do
[13:10:22]  bunhara: judt not always
[13:10:25]  bunhara: idk why
[13:10:33]  captainnoobzor: on mobile i go to another stream then come back
[13:10:35]  bunhara: the video add are way more common, but sometimes you see banner ads
[13:10:42]  captainnoobzor: and sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt
[13:11:19]  bunhara: commercials shouldve been left to television
[13:11:32]  bunhara: why the fuck does a live stream need ad interruptions
[13:12:39]  shmooooz: Because they need a way to commercialize it :)
[13:13:01]  skippygoober: what sorts of ads does twitch use? I know they do it manually instead of relying on google or whatever
[13:13:03]  surrealistic_ganerson: Do you have an anger problem? Well, we have just the perfect solution. "Smash the Sentries" ™ a new approach towards getting rid of anger. ~might have side effects, consult with a doctor
[13:13:30]  captainnoobzor: it's fine if ads run when you go to the bathroom
[13:13:37]  bunhara: yeah planning your live programs AROUND the ads is fine
[13:13:39]  captainnoobzor: just kinda aids when it's random and you get 32 ads
[13:14:18]  bunhara: i guess you can feasibly plan your streams around ads, but idk it still feels awful
[13:14:40]  bunhara: i feel like streamers shouldnt have to put everything down for the sake of ads
[13:14:51]  captainnoobzor: spire streams are just podcasts anyway
[13:16:16]  bunhara: click claw
[13:16:28]  surrealistic_ganerson: @bunhara yeah, ads shouldn't be disruptive, but the problem is I guess they know that human psyche is more easily lured in by video + audio and not just banners or something, so full on distraction and watch our ad so you buy or product
[13:18:05]  captainnoobzor: i mean
[13:18:35]  captainnoobzor: watching twitch in my bed and seeing an ad is the easiest way for me to fall asleep
[13:19:20]  captainnoobzor: yeah i just turn off my phone
[13:19:34]  captainnoobzor: maybe ads are a good thing
[13:19:39]  surrealistic_ganerson: @captainnoobzor So that's the real strat, tell your viewers to go to sleep and put you on, go to sleep yourself and wake up with money
[13:20:08]  captainnoobzor: sleeping stream meta yeah
[13:20:33]  captainnoobzor: i mean there was that band who uploaded a 30 seconds track of just silence to spotify
[13:20:44]  captainnoobzor: and asked ppl to play it on repeat
[13:21:01]  surrealistic_ganerson: @captainnoobzor based
[13:21:32]  surrealistic_ganerson: unfocus the focus run

[16:05:03]  disappointedpotaaht: feeed is the move my dad and his friends do on the tartar so they dont die of vodka the endboss
[16:05:26]  enkidu2: I'm just a slow sipper neat. I would like snacks and pairings, but that requires preparation or having food in my fridge

[16:07:49]  moneybee0: doing great thanks
[16:07:57]  moneybee0: I stole money's name
[16:07:59]  firstdane: scared money dont make none
[16:10:25]  firstdane: are you doing the auto ads?
[16:10:49]  disappointedpotaaht: @enkidu2 well traditionally I usually drink vodka in drinks, because most people see vodka as a shot but depending on how big the glass is and how comfortable you are you can down it or sipp it
[16:11:17]  moneymoneyloot: ads cringe
[16:11:42]  disappointedpotaaht: Yea I do the same thing I try to put on adds somewhere in the middle, just to keep pre-roll ads off as well
[16:11:47]  enriqueque: !sr https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPhFjFl8-XU
[16:13:10]  firstdane: i personally never mess with the ads
[16:13:17]  firstdane: 1 preroll isnt as bad as x ads per hour
[16:13:17]  disappointedpotaaht: no, it depends on when the people join, and twitch kind od try to show them in a spaced out way
[16:13:33]  disappointedpotaaht: but it might not be the intervall you have chosen
[16:13:35]  disappointedpotaaht: so
[16:13:47]  disappointedpotaaht: yeah I agree, makes it harder
[16:14:06]  enriqueque: It's kinda dumb that smaller channels get hit with preroll ads
[16:14:14]  firstdane: not that many people show up to my streams anymore so i dont want them to get spammed
[16:15:06]  firstdane: for sure all these streaming/video platforms are losing cash like crazy
[16:15:23]  enkidu2: I never see your streams anymore Dane. I think you tend to stream when i'm at work so I think I miss a lot of them
[16:15:34]  disappointedpotaaht: @enriqueque unless that streamer had hit their viewers with ads, so you either get left behind because of pre roll add, or you get left mid stream, because you try to run an ad so pre roll is off
[16:17:58]  firstdane: @enkidu2 all good i dont have the kind time that i used to when i was streaming spire all the time anyway
